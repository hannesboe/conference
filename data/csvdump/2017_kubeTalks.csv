If you are already registered for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2017, modify your registration to add the training or email us at events {at} cncf {dot} io.In the adoption of cloud native technologies developers have found one of the greatest challenges is the integration of services in distributed systems. The challenges include service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing for canary deployments and most importantly securing the communication channels.
Istio solves these problems by providing a layer of infrastructure between the services and the network that allows the service communication to be controlled outside the application code. This fundamentally changes how services are connected, managed and secured.
During thisworkshop you will gain hands-on experience to understand how Istio is changing the landscape of cloud native applications. We will walk through deploying each piece of Istio alongside a microservice application running in Kubernetes and in the process create a service mesh to control the communication. We will show features of Istio such as:

Traffic Management, Resilient Communication and Load Balancing between Services
Policy Enforcement and Rate Limiting

Kubernetes is a popular cloud-native open-source orchestration platform for container management, scaling and automated deployment. It includes a rich set of features such as service discovery, multi-tenancy, stateful containers, resource usage monitoring, and rolling updates. Some of the questions we will go over are: 

How do we deploy using infrastructure technologies like CloudFormation and Terraform?
How can CLI clients such as kops, kubeadm and minikube be used to interact with Kubernetes?
What does a clean CI/CD pipeline look like using AWS?
How do we integrate with tools such as Maven?

FD.io provides a modular, extensible user space IO services framework that supports rapid development of high-throughput low-latency resource-efficient IO services. The design of FD.io is hardware, kernel, and deployment (bare metal, VM, container) agnostic. FD.io has been integrated with OpenStack Neutron, OpenDaylight, and Calico to provide a drop in upgrade for all of your dataplane needs. A key component of FD.io is the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) library contributed at the foundation of the project. The commercial-ready code targetable to run on standard x86, ARM, and Power servers is already running in products on the market today. VPP when connected to DPDK for network IO has shown to perform two orders of magnitude faster than currently available open source options implementing switching or routing workloads, reaffirming one of the core principles of FD.io: a focus on performance.
Join us at the FD.io Mini Summit to hear and learn from FD.io community experts who will be sharing information about the projects, use cases, capabilities, integration between FD.io and OpenStack/ODL/OPNFV/Other communities, tools and many more exciting topics. This is a great opportunity for the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon attendees to share their thought leadership and innovations at one of the industry’s premier events. 
*No Show Fee - Note that while FD.io Mini Summit is free to attend, anyone that is a no-show onsite will be charged $50 for each event not attended. This helps us in planning accurately for the event.

About: Join us for a 4-hour use-case driven training session on container visibility, troubleshooting and run-time security monitoring with the Sysdig open source tools (Sysdig and Falco) and learn how containers work under the hood.
Agenda:

Visibility and troubleshooting (~1 hour)   

Learn how to debug a 502 error on a containerized LB with HPproxy, a Python webapp that crashes after working for 5 minutes or finding where you configured the wrong credentials in a microservices app.


Analyzing performance and bottlenecks (~1 hour)   

Compare the performance of different web servers running in containers, use system call tracing to find the bottleneck in your application or learn how to use spectograms (flame graphs) to visualize system call performance. 


Debugging Kubernetes (~1 hour)   

Dive into Kubernetes internals using reverse engineering: Why is that Kubernetes service valid but doesn't work? How does service resolution work? How does Kubernetes instruct Docker Engine?


Security run-time monitoring and forensics (~1 hour)   

Last but not least, all these previous lessons can also be applied for security. Not only with forensics on an attack attempt, but Sysdig Falco can alert on containers with anomalous behaviour as well.";"Intermediate";"Tuesday December  5, 2017  1:00pm";"Tuesday December  5, 2017   5:00pm";"Meeting Room 10B, Level 3";"2017-12-05T13:00:00";"2017-12-05T17:00:00"

With different work loads running across different clusters, cluster operations and insights into these applications has become an interesting problem. We wanted to know the footprint of these applications across different clusters in our data centers. One of the most obvious solutions is to query against different api servers and derive insights. However as the scale increased querying api servers has become a challenge and we could not get data in real time. To solve these problems, we developed an application called kube watch. Kube watch helps collects data for various resources from different clusters and persists into data stores. By building different dashboards using this data it helped us gain insights into the clusters in real time.

In order to onboard all applications seamlessly, and also be able to centrally make incremental updates to the Kubernetes configuration files with no disruption to customers, some kind of standardization is required. We tested many existing options, looking for a tradeoff between simplicity and power, and decided on centrally-managed templates for the configuration files.  A very simple yaml interface with standard technical verbiage was provided for customers to onboard their applications.

Still, deployment of these CRI implementations may bring us back to pre-container days, because we run into problems with additional required software such as libvirt, the need to configure the operating system on the node in different ways, and so on. We can also have problems with upgrading the CRI implementation apps, because unlike other components, they require special treatment. It would be nice if we could use the deployment power of k8s to install these apps on some of the nodes. Further complicating matters is the fact that if your CRI doesn't support Docker images, and is too different from Docker, you need to install Kubernetes components such as kube-proxy and a CNI plugin in a special way, meaning that you have to prepare special-purpose CRI nodes in a very special way.  Even if you just want to create a quick demo of your CRI that runs on Kubernetes clusters deployed using a popular tool such as kubeadm, you may need to tweak the node config just a bit to make this happen.  DaemonSet seems like it might be the right choice for a CRI implementation, but here we run into the chicken-and-egg problem, as a CRI implementation is required to be running on the node in order to run any pods there.  Enter CRI Proxy. CRI requests that deal with plain pods are handled by the primary CRI implementation (such as docker-shim), while requests that are marked in special way (using pod annotations and image name conventions) get directed to the special-purpose CRI implementation. This way, the deployment headache almost goes away - all you have to do is install CRI Proxy on the node, and the proxy has minimal dependencies. For demo installations, the proxy provides “bootstrap” mode, which automagically installs CRI Proxy on clusters installed with kubeadm, and possibly some other cluster setup tools, too.  (If we have time, I may also say a few words about hyper’s approach; they have something like CRI proxy built into their CRI implementation, which solves problem of running k8s components on the node, though it doesn’t help much with deployment problem.)";"Intermediate";"Tuesday December  5, 2017  7:00pm";"Tuesday December  5, 2017   7:05pm";"Ballroom A, Level 1";"2017-12-05T19:00:00";"2017-12-05T19:05:00"

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) was launched with the goal of developing common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology without the fear of lock-in. OCI has recently issued v1.0 of its container image format and runtime specifications, which enable a consistent and stable platform for running containerized applications.   The next phase in ensuring broad adoption of common container image format and runtime specifications is the OCI Certification program, which will be launching soon.

Jenkins is an example of an application that can take advantage of Kubernetes technology to run Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery workloads. Jenkins and Kubernetes can be integrated to transparently use on demand containers to run build agents and jobs, and isolate job execution. It also supports CI/CD-as-code using Jenkins Pipelines and automated deployments to Kubernetes clusters.

The Pyramids of Giza, for example, were not built overnight by a Pharaoh, but constructed by tens of thousands of workers over a period of years. Today’s “pyramid” is quite a bit smaller, but a wonder of the world in its own right: The iPhone has transformed the world as we know it -- but most of its power comes from the app store, which offers thousands of apps created from the imaginations of thousands of developers. These developers are the makers of marvels in our time. They instantiate the very concept of digital transformation -- that notion of infrastructure disruption and re-assembly on the mind of every CIO. Business development is driven by software development, and software development is shaped by developers in the open source community.   In her talk, Abby Kearns empowers developers to think of themselves as the doers and makers who hold the key to unlocking digital transformation.

For a successful journey of microservice adoption, Container management, DevOps and Monitoring play an important role. Managing microservices in large-scale deployments are fraught with many unique challenges for enterprise IT. Following are some of the key metrics of microservice monitoring which will enable the enterprises to manage their container platforms better: 1. Collecting logs, metrics from containers 2. Monitoring application running inside the container 3. Distributed tracing and the time taken by each service call. 4. Storage, analysis of collected metrics, logs 5. Performing RCA and anomaly detection on the collected logs and metrics  This session would explain how to harness the power of Zipkin with the intelligence of Spark ecosystem and the flexibility of ELK+ Beats to create a unified monitoring solution.

With orchestration clusters supporting thousands of nodes, any risk assessment solution must work at production scale. Once a trusted image is deemed vulnerable, application risk increases, but which applications are impacted, and how far has trust been broken? Trust is established through best practices including the use of trusted image registries, static code analysis, fuzzing, strong perimeter defenses and deployment controls. Unfortunately, this trust model omits information flow. Malicious actors succeed when applications are most vulnerable. When devising action plans in response to security disclosures, defenders must quickly assess both the impact and scope of the disclosure. This time to remediation requires accurate and actionable vulnerability assessments as applications are created, deployed and scaled. Enhancing security information flow accelerates risk mitigation at production scale.";"Intermediate";"Wednesday December  6, 2017 11:10am";"Wednesday December  6, 2017 1 11:45am";"Meeting Room 6AB, Level 3";"2017-12-06T11:10:00";"2017-12-06T01:11:45"

The threats targeting organizations only continue to increase in severity and frequency, and even simple attacks can cause considerable damage. Cloud-native development is a vital evolution for security in the enterprise, as it equips organizations with the same tools and processes that modern fast-moving organizations rely on.   Cloud-native needs to be considered a new culture, not just a technological shift, when it comes to IT. This is because cloud-native changes the processes of DevOps, which requires automated security processes and application awareness. With cloud-native culture, security needs to be truly application aware and based upon developer intent. Using application intent analysis, developers have a new way of looking at applications, specifically containerized apps. They can produce produce a more predictable and secure container environment that can be effectively enforced.  The unique nature of container technology allows the developer intent-based security model to capitalize on the following pillars:   1. Containers are declarative. When a developer writes the code, he/she does not just write the code, he/she writes a manifest that describes how this code should work and how it should interact with its environment. While the developer does not provide you with a real security manifest, you can translate the extra information that you have and try to create a security profile. With containers, you have a Docker file, you might have a pod, and you might have an application group if you’re running on top of mesosphere. There is a lot of information in the system that you could use in order to understand what is supposed to happen.  2. Containers are predictable. When you look at containers, they contain less specific logic and more common building blocks because containers are typically made out of downloadable layers that someone else created.   3. Containers are immutable. In the past, it was hard to understand if something happening with the application was really an attack or not. But in the case of containers, whenever you patch a container or change its real intent, it should not happen in real time. What happens is the developer changes things and then he/she pushes in a new version. He patches the OS or adds new functionality and then pushes in a new container and scratches the old one. This gives you a lot of power from a security standpoint because, for the first time ever, if you see a polymorphic change in the behavior of the application (if it starts behaving differently) that means it’s either a configuration drift or a real attack.  By leveraging these three pillars -- declarative nature, predictability and immutability -- there’s a powerful opportunity to use whitelisting, for example, to approve known good processes. In combination with application intent analysis, enforcement measures help support the intent-based security model and preserve the original intent of the application.";"Intermediate";"Wednesday December  6, 2017 11:55am";"Wednesday December  6, 2017 1 12:30pm";"Meeting Room 5ABC, Level 3";"2017-12-06T11:55:00";"2017-12-06T13:12:30"

In the face of highly dynamic compute and network resources, a new challenge has risen: how to authenticate and secure service-to-service traffic in this brave new world? Enter the problem known as service identity.  Getting service identity right is surprisingly hard, with requirements extending well beyond simple secret management. What kind of credentials to settle on, how to rotate them, how to automatically (and securely) bootstrap them... and even more importantly, how to make sure a wide variety of external systems can authenticate them appropriately? These questions represent only a subset of the points that must be solved for.  In this talk, we introduce both SPIFFE and SPIRE - a new open source project designed to solve exactly these problems. SPIRE, backed by the SPIFFE open standard, performs seamless node and workload attestation across various platforms, and automatically issue short-lived certificates based on those attestations in a controlled manner. Even better, these certificates work across organizational boundaries and heterogeneous environments thanks to SPIFFE, which introduces a standardized identity format and validation methodology for X.509 certificates.";"Intermediate";"Wednesday December  6, 2017  2:00pm";"Wednesday December  6, 2017   2:35pm";"Meeting Room 5ABC, Level 3";"2017-12-06T14:00:00";"2017-12-06T14:35:00"

The public cloud offers freedom from lead times and elasticity to manage changing workloads, but once a workload reaches a certain size or can be forecasted over a longer period of time it may be much more expensive than building and operating the compute infrastructure in-house.

Complexity is the enemy of security.  This heterogeneity is its embodiment. Having many different ways to configure access policies on different cloud providers or with different vendors, makes it impossible to understand whom has access to what in any given infrastructure.  Without this visibility it is impossible to have intelligibility, and hence security.  
Worse, today developers and operators must exist in and support a highly dynamic service environment.  That is to say existing services must evolve to support new functionality, and new services must be rapidly brought on line to support features in a highly competitive business environment.  The miasma of different configuration schemes creates a great deal of friction against this, and impedes security because it is difficult to holistically understand the impact of changes (let alone make them rapidly).  Security must be able to accommodate this temporality.
In this talk we introduce PADME as an architecture for policy admission aimed at solving these problems in a distributed environment.  PADME operates by normalizing access policy information across underlying clouds and system.  It allows policies to be operated up as known fixed building blocks in order to establish end to end security.  Finally, it attacks the problem of policy distribution in a distributed environment so that assertions can be made about the security of a system over time, and in the face of CAP theorem issues.";"Intermediate";"Wednesday December  6, 2017  2:45pm";"Wednesday December  6, 2017   3:20pm";"Meeting Room 5ABC, Level 3";"2017-12-06T14:45:00";"2017-12-06T15:20:00"

It offers a small footprint high performance engine with advance load balancing algorithms, caching, SSL termination, API gateway, extensibility through broad range of third-party modules, sciptability with Lau and nginScript and various security features with granular access control.   Microservices also require a Web Server to be deployed side-by-side with the service proxy.

Its goal is to be a stable container runtime tied to kubernetes releases, replacing the docker daemon.  Historically every update of Docker has broken Kubernetes. This has led to major rewriting and fixes of Kubernetes, which is understandable since Docker is not primarily for Kubernetes. Kubernetes needs a container runtime dedicated to its specifications.   CRI-O, the name comes from the Container Runtime Interface for Open container runtimes, takes advantages of emerging standards like OCI Runtime and Image Specification, as well as open source projects to handle container images (github.com:containers/image, github.com:containers/storage) . This means as these projects advance CRI-O will be able to take advantage of the improvements and features, but all the while guaranteeing that it will not break any functionality required by the Kubernetes CRI. CRI-O works with runc and Clear Containers runtimes.   CRI-O was designed from the ground up to satisfy Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface, and currently passes all node and E2E tests. The github repository has been setup to not accept any pull requests that causes these tests to break. We will be tying the versions of CRI-O to the Kubernetes versions, to maintain complete compatibility.

In 2017, Netflix is recognized as one of the industry leaders at building and operating “cloud native” systems at scale. Like many organizations, Netflix has unique security requirements for many of their workloads. This variety requires a holistic approach to authorization to address “who can do what” across a range of resources, enforcement points, and execution environments.  In this talk, Manish Mehta (Senior Security Software Engineer at Netflix) and Torin Sandall (Technical Lead of the Open Policy Agent project) will present how Netflix is solving authorization across the stack in cloud native environments. The presentation shows how Netflix enforces authorization decisions at scale across various kinds of resources (e.g., HTTP APIs, gRPC methods, SSH), enforcement points (e.g., microservices, proxies, host-level daemons), and execution environments (e.g., VMs, containers) without introducing unreasonable latency. The presentation includes a deep dive into the architecture of the cloud native authorization system at Netflix as well as how authorization decisions can be offloaded to an open source, general-purpose policy engine (Open Policy Agent).  This talk is targeted at engineers building and operating cloud native systems who are interested in security and authorization.

One common intelligent edge deployment is the buildout of mini data centers on network edge that are centrally managed and operated by the cloud. Unlike traditional data centers, these mini data centers are constrained by limited resources and minimal operational supervision, and as such they impose challenges on traditional data center infrastructure including network services, here defined as L3-7 network services such as packet gateway and application firewall. These services usually are implemented with the need for heavy manual configurations and complex provisioning, which are particularly ill-fitted to deploy at the edge.  In this session we will discuss how we built a new edge computing platform for network services that can achieve auto provisioning, dynamic service deployments and updates, and high resiliency. By running componentized network services in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, and utilizing projects such as gRPC, linkerd, and fluentd, as well as making use of cloud native related projects including etcd and IOvisor, this platform essentially treats network services as cloud native applications, and thereby able to achieve the associated benefits. We will show a demo of the platform as part of the presentation.";"Intermediate";"Wednesday December  6, 2017  3:40pm";"Wednesday December  6, 2017   4:15pm";"Meeting Room 9C, Level 3";"2017-12-06T15:40:00";"2017-12-06T16:15:00"

What's less well understood is how to do it for thousands of services running on behalf of hundreds of possibly competing customers, in particular how to do it securely, protect the privacy of each customer, and support binary protocols other than HTTP. This is the problem that our company solved for our SaaS business which requires hosting and operating the control plane of popular infrastructure management software (e.g. Openstack, Big Data, and Kubernetes itself) as a service for our customers. Those control planes contain services exposing protocols as varied as MySQL and AMQP. This talk describes the challenges we faced and how we solved them using multiple technologies from the Kubernetes ecosystem. The solution includes a system that automatically creates namespaces, provisions certificate hierarchies, and manages ingress controllers for new customers, then wraps services with a set of side-car containers to handle tasks such as TLS termination. We describe how we employed Kubernetes native constructs such as Custom Resource Definitions to automate those tasks. For network communications, we discuss how to securely handle ingress, outgress, pod-to-pod, and cross-namespace traffic. To support both HTTP and TCP-based protocols, we describe a two-level network routing system consisting of both a ""k8sniff"" and an nginx ingress controller. For ensuring customer data privacy we compare these approaches: (1) Network Policy + Layer 2 virtualization; (2) TLS encryption of all pod-to-pod traffic; (3) a combination of the two. Finally, we debate whether the process isolation model of Linux containers is sufficient, and discuss our experience with stronger virtualization-based mechanisms such as Frakti / HyperContainer.";"Advanced";"Wednesday December  6, 2017  4:25pm";"Wednesday December  6, 2017   5:00pm";"Meeting Room 5ABC, Level 3";"2017-12-06T16:25:00";"2017-12-06T17:00:00"

Are you interested in seeing how Kubernetes stands up to the record-breaking viewership and a login rate that is beyond belief on Game of Thrones Season 7 premiere? Come and see things we have done for the Game of Thrones preparation. We will talk about how we provision Kubernetes clusters on AWS, and how we monitor them and microservices that are running on the clusters.  In this talk, we will also go over how HBO Go went from deploying and running microservices on virtual machines in AWS EC2 to running the very same services inside the Kubernetes clusters. We were able to dramatically increase the productivity of our engineering teams and efficiency of resource utilization in the process. It wasn’t always a smooth ride and it wasn’t a one shot deal. Instead, it was a long and at times challenging journey starting from operating a reliable, production-ready Kubernetes cluster in AWS, advancing to gradually deploying select services into Kubernetes clusters, load testing them, and running them in parallel to our current EC2 installations, and finally going live.

While we still have work to do, in the past several months the community has done great work to solve a whole host of issues to make Kubernetes “suck less.” In this talk I will outline the ways that the community has made this happen both in the core project and in the wider ecosystem.  Things are still developing, but here are the areas that I want to highlight. Hopefully we'll have talks on many of these so that I can highlight where and when folks can find out more. I won't be able to cover everything happening in the ecosystem but I can hint at the diversity and commitment to solving these issues.  * *Simpler application description.* As a community we are continuing to build more tcapable and simpler tools for describing applications through projects like ksonnet, OpenCompose, Kompose, and Helm. * *Serverless platforms.* Through “function as a service” like systems we can abstract much of the nitty gritty around getting code packaged and running. In addition, scaling can be easy and automatic as code is run only when needed. * *Simpler cluster install and admin.* kubeadm and how it is becoming a common toolkit. Similar work is ongoing to explore the idea of standardizing the description of a cluster at the infrastructure level through projects like Kubicorn. In addition, new APIs, such as the certificates API, are key building blocks for getting secure clusters up and running. * *Curated development experiences.* Systems like Draft help to automate the build/launch/update cycle for development workflows. Others are also exploring ways to connect developers to clusters. * *Making Kubernetes boring.* Kubernetes is maturing as a platform. As that happens, things in the ""nucleus"" are slowing down. In the past 6 months we've seen a concerted effort to encourage new features to be built with extensibility mechanisms as much as possible. This allows those projects to move fast while enabling exploration of the problem space. * *Conformance.* Another key enabler for widespread Kubernetes adoption is conformance. There has been a wide set of folks involved in describing what should get to be called ""Kubernetes"". Tools like Sonobuoy point the direction to making this be an automated process that anyone can run against any cluster. * *Observability.* Prometheus continues to be the go-to OSS solution for monitoring in the Kubernetes world. In additions, systems like linkerd and Istio/envoy enable introspection at the microservice mesh level.  We still have many challenges. Many of these are going to take long concerted efforts to fix. We are trapped, in some ways, by our promise of backward compatibility. It is often better to live with something annoying than to force breaking changes on our user base.  *Call to action:* Great job community! But the job isn't done. Let's keep working hard to bring Kubernetes to a larger and larger set of users and environments.";"Any";"Thursday December  7, 2017 11:10am";"Thursday December  7, 2017 1 11:45am";"Ballroom A, Level 1";"2017-12-07T11:10:00";"2017-12-07T01:11:45"

With so many different components working together it can be hard to know how the pieces work together or where new products and features fit in. I will start at the highest level and then peel off the layers one at time to explain how some of the ""magic"" happens. Over the course of the presentation I will break Kubernetes into the following layers:  ""Kubernetes for the End User"": A quick summary on some of the core components of Kubernetes: Namespaces, Deployments, Pods, Services, and Ingress Rules. At this layer the user just needs to understand the promises made by Kubernetes, not necessarily the way it keeps them. This layer primarily serves to establish a typical cluster workload. The resources defined here will be used when explaining all of the deeper layers.  ""Kubernetes for the Cluster Admin"": This Layer peels away some of the cluster ""Magic"". I will cover how the service account, default tokens, ReplicaSet and Pods from the previous layer got created by the kube-controller-manager. I will also explain how the kube-scheduler decided which node the workload should run on and how that decision could have been influenced by fields in the pod spec. This section will touch on the core concepts of Ingress controllers, Admission Controllers, scheduling, and core controller loops.   ""Kubernetes for the Cloud Admin"": This layer covers Kubernetes at an infrastructure level. Core concepts covered are: Horizontal Scaling, Load Balancing, high availability for masters and nodes, node management, and fault-tolerance levels. Here is also where I set the stage for the network layer that is covered next.  ""Kubernetes for the Network Admin"": Now we dig deeper into the network infrastructure. Explaining how pods and services work together, how your network traffic figures out where to go, and how it gets there. This section covers the concepts of East-West and North-South load balancing. The goal is to provide an basic understanding of the network promises made by Kubernetes and how you might replace them with other software and services.  ""Kubernetes for the Linux Admin"": A discussion of Kubernetes at the OS layer. This layer digs into the processes and configuration of the base OS. This includes pluggable container engines ex: Docker vs. Rkt, logging, CNI, metric gathering and volume mounting.  ""Kubernetes for the Power-User"": Time permitting, the final section will put all of the previous ones together to show how a next-generation application might be deployed on top of Kubernetes and take advantage of the more advanced features.";"Intermediate";"Thursday December  7, 2017 11:10am";"Thursday December  7, 2017 1 11:45am";"Meeting Room 19AB, Level 4";"2017-12-07T11:10:00";"2017-12-07T01:11:45"

Most cloud native applications written today follow the microservice architecture. These applications are distributed by nature, and therefore hard to debug.  Microservice engineers debug their applications by printing values of select variables into log files. This leaves them with the daunting task of sorting through reams of log data, which at best provide a partial view of the state of application. This approach is cumbersome, time consuming and works better with ""easy"" bugs.  Many advanced tools to debug monolitic applications exist in the market, and provide users with powerful ways to dissect their programs and to interact with them on the fly. However, these tools cannot be used directly for debugging applications that follow the microservice architecture pattern.  Squash is designed to bring the strength of modern debuggers and the convenience of their IDEs to microservices developers.

In collaboration with industry partners, IHME have deployed a unique solution based on Univa’s Navops technology that allows them to combine containerized and traditional analytic and high-performance application workloads on a single shared Kubernetes cluster, ensuring departmental SLAs and helping contain infrastructure costs. In this talk Dr. Grandison will discuss IHME, their experience deploying containerized applications and how they went about using Kubernetes to support a variety of new containerized applications as well as a variety of traditional analytic applications.";"Any";"Thursday December  7, 2017 11:55am";"Thursday December  7, 2017 1 12:30pm";"Ballroom B, Level 1";"2017-12-07T11:55:00";"2017-12-07T13:12:30"

It is now only a matter of minutes to go from zero to a running cluster on Amazon Web Services. There are still many fundamental topics to take a simple setup to something that can be run in production in a large enterprise and it is easy to get confused by the number of options and customizations.  In this talk we will show both common practices for running Kubernetes on AWS and an opinionated view of those. Specifically, we will cover options and recommendations on how to install and manage clusters, configure high availability, perform rolling upgrades and handle disaster recovery, as well as continuous integration and deployment of applications, logging, and security.

Avoid vendor lock-in by running functions in your own datacenter or the cloud with your existing CI/CD and container ecosystem. The project focuses on ease of use through its UI and CLI which can be used to test and monitor functions in tandem with Prometheus integration that enables auto-scaling as demand increases.
You can deploy OpenFaaS in 60 seconds on Kubernetes and thanks to concise code templates all you need to write is a handler in your favourite programming language then let your cluster do the heavy lifting.

OpenFaaS was recently trending as the top open-source project on GitHub, won Best Cloud Computing Software 2017 from InfoWorld and has a thriving community with 65 contributors, 1400 commits and over 8k stars.

Over the years Kubernetes has added a number of sophisticated features to strengthen its multitenancy support, for example RBAC, PodSecuityPolicy, NetworkPolicy, priority/preemption, etc.
Now is a good time to take stock of Kubernetes' multitenancy support from the perspective of different types of users -- for example small organizations where everyone trusts each other, large enterprises that need isolation between many internal teams and applications sharing a cluster, SaaS providers hosting instances of their SaaS for many users in a single cluster, and infrastructure providers offering hosted ""Kubernetes as a Service"" -- and ask what are the key gaps remaining to be filled. Do we need hierarchical namespaces? Better mechanisms to hide shared resources so users can't see who they're sharing the cluster with? Multitenancy policies (quota, RBAC, etc.) that span namespaces, or that apply to a label-selected subset of objects within a namespace? Split-horizon DNS? Resource scheduling within the control plane to ensure no tenant monopolizes the API server, controllers, scheduler, etc.? Where on the spectrum from ""soft multitenancy"" to ""hard multitenancy"" should Kubernetes aim (and what do these terms mean, anyway?)

One of the powers these documents wield is that they help serve as a “north star” that guides an entire community toward the same goals.  I believe we need a similar guide for Kubernetes. It would describe how app developers and operators should think about and use the features in Kubernetes to build and deploy reliable, stable apps. Armed with such a guide, we could all hope to better understand the “essence” of Kubernetes in pursuit of building better cloud native apps.  We don’t have anything like this today, but many in the Kubernetes community have strong, detailed opinions for what should go in this guide. Much of it is tribal knowledge or scattered in blog posts.   In this talk, I’ll try to bring many of these opinions together and lay out an “Elements of Kubernetes” guide for app developers and operators alike. I’ll do so by relating each “element” to stories and details I’ve seen in the community that reveal what makes a good Kubernetes and cloud native app.";"Intermediate";"Thursday December  7, 2017  2:45pm";"Thursday December  7, 2017   3:20pm";"Meeting Room 19AB, Level 4";"2017-12-07T14:45:00";"2017-12-07T15:20:00"

Well, not quite: there are still some important unknowns to understand before your service will be ready for production traffic. It's still unclear how the new service behaves when it's being pushed, and it's possible that Kubernetes will kill the service before serving a single request. At Buffer, we've developed a technique to optimize Kubernetes deployment limits by using load testing to identify optimal values for resource limits. When the service is under heavy load there are a few key metrics to watch to identify bottlenecks. These key metrics can be used to adjust resource limits. This real world approach allowed us to safely and efficiently switch over more than half our production traffic to our Kubernetes cluster and can be applied to any application.  This talk will include a live demo of how to tune Etcd using methods we do at Buffer.";"Any";"Thursday December  7, 2017  2:45pm";"Thursday December  7, 2017   3:20pm";"Ballroom C, Level 1";"2017-12-07T14:45:00";"2017-12-07T15:20:00"

Users write functions and map them to event sources, such as HTTP requests, timers, Kubernetes watches, and message queues. Users don't have to deal with container images, registries or even learn Kubernetes in much detail.  Functions consume CPU and memory resources only when running. Fission makes on-demand function loading very fast by keeping an idle pool of containers running, in effect creating a distributed ""threadpool"".  Fission is useful for: * Creating web app backends or REST APIs * Implementing webhooks * Watching Kubernetes Resources for changes to implement simple custom controllers * Creating Kubernetes Initializers with minimal work  In this talk we'll give a few demos for these use cases, and cover:  * How fission works with function dependencies in a language-agnostic manner * The development lifecycle of Functions: testing and incremental deployment * The composition of functions into workflows using the Fission Workflow project * Observability: log aggregation, metrics with Prometheus, tracing with Opentracing/Zipkin * The interaction of functions with service meshes (Istio/Envoy)";"Beginner";"Thursday December  7, 2017  2:45pm";"Thursday December  7, 2017   3:20pm";"Meeting Room 9AB, Level 3";"2017-12-07T14:45:00";"2017-12-07T15:20:00"

At UC Berkeley, we are trying - our 'Foundations of Data Science' course has no pre-requisites, and routinely attracts more than a 1000 students from across majors. 
Requiring students to have local programming environments installed & debugged is a non-starter at this scale. We have been running a Kubernetes based JupyterHub environment that allows them to do all their programming with a web based environment with Jupyter Notebooks. This is an important change in many ways:
1. Lets students start instantly with writing code, rather than dealing with the accidental complexity of installing software locally
2. Acts as an equalizer - a student using a chromebook borrowed from the library has no disadvantage over someone using an expensive Macbook Pro
3. This is course critical infrastructure, and needs high availability at low human / dollar cost

This provides better utilization of resources and enables our service developers to write serverless functions with simple declarations. Kubernetes provides Jobs and Deployments as design constructs to handle such needs, while other frameworks like IronIO Functions, Fabric8, et al aim to solve end-to-end use case . However, we had to extend on top of Kubernetes Jobs & Deployments to define the packaging and I/O interactions of the function, implement a priority queue for execution, and provide declarative retry policy while ensuring high availability. A developer 'writes' a function supporting common EAI patterns for start time parameterized variables, and defines it's packaging and scheduling using a yaml file. The framework then packages it as a Container alongwith an 'observer' container in a pod, 'registers' it with the scheduler while ensuring choice of 'warm' vs on-demand requisite replicas of the pod, and then through a 'Scalar' manages the execution and life cycle of job, while logging and tracing failures/success.

In this talk, we will discuss the various cluster security models available today, and how to use namespaces to provide tenant isolation. We will also demonstrate how to use Kubernetes’ Role Based Access Control (RBAC) feature as means of enforcing a multi-tenant security model. By assigning roles and role bindings and creating namespaces, we can implement restrictions on resource consumption and provide tenant isolation throughout the cluster. We’ll also demonstrate how the RBAC feature provides granularity of access control that can be adjusted to suit varying requirements—from granting full access to users or groups to a cluster to only granting access to specific resources within a namespace. Following the discussion of how to build a security model with namespaces and RBAC, this talk will also feature a live demonstration of RBAC and namespaces in action to illustrate the concepts and show how both admins and developers are affected by the model.";"Intermediate";"Thursday December  7, 2017  4:35pm";"Thursday December  7, 2017   5:10pm";"Meeting Room 12AB, Level 4";"2017-12-07T16:35:00";"2017-12-07T17:10:00"

The serverless billing model is simple - pay-per-invocation - which can being significant benefits for many event-driven applications.  Huawei launched its FunctionStage serverless platform, which is built on Kubernetes, in 2017. In this talk we will explain in detail the design and implementation of FunctionStage. This involved both fairly straightforward function packaging, scheduling, auto-scaling, event triggering and load balancing, as well as some significantly more interesting challenges related to container re-use, on-the-fly micro service provisioning, reliable operation and much more.

Without having an approximate view of the remaining capacity in a cluster, it is hard for cluster operators to decide if and when the cluster should be provisioned with more capacity or not. In Kubernetes clusters, capacity is associated with worker nodes in terms of resources such as cpu, memory or storage. Discussing capacity in terms of individual resources may be a bit ambiguous because a Pod is the smallest schedulable unit in Kubernetes clusters. Therefore, cluster operators may be more interested in knowing an approximate number of pods of a specific size (amount of resources) that can be scheduled on a cluster. This talk will introduce a new tool, called cluster capacity, that can be used to analyze the capacity of a Kubernetes cluster in this way. First, the talk will discuss about its use cases, followed by its design and implementation as a scheduling simulator. The talk will also include a demo to demonstrate various ways the tool can be run against a Kubernetes cluster. This talk will conclude with the discussion of future directions for this tool.";"Any";"Friday December  8, 2017 11:10am";"Friday December  8, 2017 1 11:45am";"Meeting Room 10AB, Level 3";"2017-12-08T11:10:00";"2017-12-08T01:11:45"

We will show how we can provision kafka clusters and configure it using kubernetes concepts and an operator process. The kafka and zookeeper cluster elements will be provisioned using StatefulSet. As these applications benefit from high performance storage, we will also show how we can use node selectors or persistent volume claims to schedule instances on correct hardware. In order for clients to use it, the necessary message topics have to be configured in kafka cluster. We will show how using an operator process, based on kubernetes custom resources or ConfigMaps we can manage this configuration in descriptive manner and ensure consistent configuration across different development and operations stages as well as cluster restarts.

We encountered significant challenges in our transition to a microservice-based architecture. Each new service increased the operations burden to provision and maintain a growing fleet of servers, frequently slowing the process of adding new services and scaling existing services in our datacenters.  I’ll discuss how we used Kubernetes to containerize our microservice ecosystem and solve those challenges. To effectively work with ephemeral Kubernetes pods, we replaced Graphite with Prometheus and Sensu with AlertManager to monitor service health rather than individual instances. We discovered massive performance issues containerizing our Java services and worked around JVM complexities. To ease our transition from virtualization to containerization, services running inside and outside of Kubernetes must seamlessly discover each other with Consul and communicate with each other. Thanks to Calico, BGP, and our Leaf-Spine Layer 3 network topology, we efficiently route pod network traffic with the rest of our network.";"Intermediate";"Friday December  8, 2017 11:55am";"Friday December  8, 2017 1 12:30pm";"Ballroom B, Level 1";"2017-12-08T11:55:00";"2017-12-08T13:12:30"

Traditionally, the uncertainty of SPIs (they can be terminated at any time due to price fluctuations) have made managing them tricky, and restricted them to specific workloads and use cases. Kubernetes, in contrast, not only handles node failure very well, it has trained developers and architects to design applications to tolerate and even embrace failure. The prospect of Kubernetes abstracting the complexities of SPIs is now a reality, enabling applications to take advantage of low-cost compute across different clouds and possibly vendors. The purpose of this talk is to educate the audience on strategies for making the most out of this powerful combination. Specifically, we will discuss these topics: 1. What are spot bidding strategies, and what is their cost vs. predictability trade-off? 2. What class of Kubernetes applications would benefit the most from SPIs? 3. Available Kubernetes mechanisms (e.g taints/tolerations, affinity, availability zones) for placing applications based on their tolerance with SPIs 3. Implementation strategies (e.g. blending multiple autoscaling groups to satisfy both SPI-optimized applications vs. applications that are more mission-critical or stateful) 4. What out-of-the box solutions exist, either free or commercial? 5. How to take abstract away clouds from different regions and vendors, allowing workloads to always take advantage of the best available pricing?  The talk concludes with real-world test results involving multiple use cases and configurations, giving the audience an idea of the potential cost savings and trade-offs (if any) of combining Kubernetes and SPIs.";"Intermediate";"Friday December  8, 2017  2:00pm";"Friday December  8, 2017   2:35pm";"Meeting Room 8ABC, Level 3";"2017-12-08T14:00:00";"2017-12-08T14:35:00"

The need to support multiple orchestration frameworks can result in added cost and complexity as organizations struggle to manage separate, siloed environments. Based on earlier work done for HPC users, Univa has contributed their Universal Resource Broker (URB) Technology to the Kubernetes community as an open-source project. The freely available software allows any Mesos compatible framework including (including Spark, Hadoop, Storm, Jenkins, Marathon and Chronos) to run along-side native Kubernetes services on a shared Kubernetes cluster providing the opportunity simplify environments and consolidate infrastructure. In his talk Mr. Ferstl will discuss the challenge of running mixed workloads on Kubernetes, provide an architectural overview of the URB and provide a demonstration of the technology. He will also explain how Mesos users or application developers can get started quickly with the technology, and consider it for use in their own environments and applications.";"Any";"Friday December  8, 2017  2:45pm";"Friday December  8, 2017   3:20pm";"Ballroom C, Level 1";"2017-12-08T14:45:00";"2017-12-08T15:20:00"

A Containerized standalone Cinder service makes these features and extensive storage products available to Kubernetes cluster.  Key to this architecture is a Kubernetes volume provisioner that provisions Cinder volumes and transparently converts Cinder volumes to Kubernetes supported storage types, such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel, NFS, or Ceph RBD.

Given a highly salable and distributed microservices deployment is going to face failures at different layers, how do we make these microservices resilient and fault tolerant? How do we enforce policy decisions such as fine-grained access control and rate limits? How do we enabled timeouts/retries, health checks etc? Even though some language specific frameworks address these issues, the implementation is often framework or language specific.   If the underlying framework or language changes, the resiliency features need to be reimplemented or ported over. And in some cases, applications also have the responsibility of implementing the code and configuration required for resiliency and fault tolerance. A Service-mesh architecture attempts to solve these issues by extracting the common resiliency features needed by a microservice framework away from the applications and frameworks and into the platform itself. Istio provides an easy way to create this service mesh.  In this talk we will discuss how to build, deploy, connect your Java microservices leveraging Istio service mesh. We then show how to configure and use circuit breakers, timeouts/retries, rate limits and other advanced resiliency features from Istio without changing the application code.";"Intermediate";"Friday December  8, 2017  3:40pm";"Friday December  8, 2017   4:15pm";"Meeting Room 9AB, Level 3";"2017-12-08T15:40:00";"2017-12-08T16:15:00"

For a platform at this scale, it is critical to have a powerful and flexible ingress routing layer (controller) that is able to handle the dynamic behavior of container based applications, such as auto-scaling, frequently changing pod IP addresses, self-serve onboarding and cluster-aware routing. This L7 routing layer must be quick to react to changes on the cluster without affecting its routing capabilities and impacting the in-flight requests. In a multi-tenant system it is even more vital that a single application deployment does not cause an impact to user traffic or hinder the release velocity of other tenants.   We developed an ingress controller based on Apache Traffic Server that satisfies the requirements stated above, while remaining scalable and easy to integrate with both Kubernetes and the Oath ecosystem.
