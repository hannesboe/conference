If you are already registered for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2017, modify your registration to add the training or email us at events {at} cncf {dot} io.In the adoption of cloud native technologies developers have found one of the greatest challenges is the integration of services in distributed systems. The challenges include service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing for canary deployments and most importantly securing the communication channels.
Istio solves these problems by providing a layer of infrastructure between the services and the network that allows the service communication to be controlled outside the application code. This fundamentally changes how services are connected, managed and secured.
During thisworkshop you will gain hands-on experience to understand how Istio is changing the landscape of cloud native applications. We will walk through deploying each piece of Istio alongside a microservice application running in Kubernetes and in the process create a service mesh to control the communication. We will show features of Istio such as:

Traffic Management, Resilient Communication and Load Balancing between Services
Policy Enforcement and Rate Limiting
Telemetry, Monitoring and Reporting
Securing Communication between

If you are already registered for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2017, modify your registration to add the training or email us at events {at} cncf {dot} io.FD.io (Fast Data) is the first truly open data plane project focusing on data IO performance, scalability, efficiency, and programmable flexibility for networking and storage. FD.io provides a modular, extensible user space IO services framework that supports rapid development of high-throughput low-latency resource-efficient IO services. The design of FD.io is hardware, kernel, and deployment (bare metal, VM, container) agnostic. FD.io has been integrated with OpenStack Neutron, OpenDaylight, and Calico to provide a drop in upgrade for all of your dataplane needs. A key component of FD.io is the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) library contributed at the foundation of the project. The commercial-ready code targetable to run on standard x86, ARM, and Power servers is already running in products on the market today. VPP when connected to DPDK for network IO has shown to perform two orders of magnitude faster than currently available open source options implementing switching or routing workloads, reaffirming one of the core principles of FD.io: a focus on performance.
Join us at the FD.io Mini Summit to hear and learn from FD.io community experts who will be sharing information about the projects, use cases, capabilities, integration between FD.io and OpenStack/ODL/OPNFV/Other communities, tools and many more exciting topics. This is a great opportunity for the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon attendees to share their thought leadership and innovations at one of the industry’s premier events. 
*No Show Fee - Note that while FD.io Mini Summit is free to attend, anyone that is a no-show onsite will be charged $50 for each event not attended. This helps us in planning accurately for the event.

With different work loads running across different clusters, cluster operations and insights into these applications has become an interesting problem. We wanted to know the footprint of these applications across different clusters in our data centers. One of the most obvious solutions is to query against different api servers and derive insights. However as the scale increased querying api servers has become a challenge and we could not get data in real time. To solve these problems, we developed an application called kube watch. Kube watch helps collects data for various resources from different clusters and persists into data stores. By building different dashboards using this data it helped us gain insights into the clusters in real time. During this talk we shall go through the kube watch system, its architecture and the problems it has helped us to solve."üBeginnerüTuesday December  5, 2017  5:40pmüTuesday December  5, 2017   5:45pmüBallroom A, Level 1

In order to onboard all applications seamlessly, and also be able to centrally make incremental updates to the Kubernetes configuration files with no disruption to customers, some kind of standardization is required. We tested many existing options, looking for a tradeoff between simplicity and power, and decided on centrally-managed templates for the configuration files.  A very simple yaml interface with standard technical verbiage was provided for customers to onboard their applications.

b24534a8a6741e137df8e57ff3b1c69füLightning Talk: CRI Proxy: Solving the Chicken-and-Egg Problem of Running a CRI Implementation as a DaemonSet [I]üLightning Talkü"CRI allows for special-purpose CRI implementations such as Virtlet, which makes it possible to run VMs as if they were containers. Still, deployment of these CRI implementations may bring us back to pre-container days, because we run into problems with additional required software such as libvirt, the need to configure the operating system on the node in different ways, and so on. We can also have problems with upgrading the CRI implementation apps, because unlike other components, they require special treatment. It would be nice if we could use the deployment power of k8s to install these apps on some of the nodes. Further complicating matters is the fact that if your CRI doesn't support Docker images, and is too different from Docker, you need to install Kubernetes components such as kube-proxy and a CNI plugin in a special way, meaning that you have to prepare special-purpose CRI nodes in a very special way.  Even if you just want to create a quick demo of your CRI that runs on Kubernetes clusters deployed using a popular tool such as kubeadm, you may need to tweak the node config just a bit to make this happen.  DaemonSet seems like it might be the right choice for a CRI implementation, but here we run into the chicken-and-egg problem, as a CRI implementation is required to be running on the node in order to run any pods there.  Enter CRI Proxy. CRI requests that deal with plain pods are handled by the primary CRI implementation (such as docker-shim), while requests that are marked in special way (using pod annotations and image name conventions) get directed to the special-purpose CRI implementation. This way, the deployment headache almost goes away - all you have to do is install CRI Proxy on the node, and the proxy has minimal dependencies. For demo installations, the proxy provides “bootstrap” mode, which automagically installs CRI Proxy on clusters installed with kubeadm, and possibly some other cluster setup tools, too.  (If we have time, I may also say a few words about hyper’s approach; they have something like CRI proxy built into their CRI implementation, which solves problem of running k8s components on the node, though it doesn’t help much with deployment problem.)"üIntermediateüTuesday December  5, 2017  7:00pmüTuesday December  5, 2017   7:05pmüBallroom A, Level 1

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) was launched with the goal of developing common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology without the fear of lock-in. OCI has recently issued v1.0 of its container image format and runtime specifications, which enable a consistent and stable platform for running containerized applications.   The next phase in ensuring broad adoption of common container image format and runtime specifications is the OCI Certification program, which will be launching soon. This session will provide an overview and goals of the program, factors to consider if becoming OCI-certified makes sense for your container project, how to get your container project OCI-certified, and how you might be able to gain interoperability benefits from OCI-certified solutions.

With orchestration clusters supporting thousands of nodes, any risk assessment solution must work at production scale. Once a trusted image is deemed vulnerable, application risk increases, but which applications are impacted, and how far has trust been broken? Trust is established through best practices including the use of trusted image registries, static code analysis, fuzzing, strong perimeter defenses and deployment controls. Unfortunately, this trust model omits information flow. Malicious actors succeed when applications are most vulnerable. When devising action plans in response to security disclosures, defenders must quickly assess both the impact and scope of the disclosure. This time to remediation requires accurate and actionable vulnerability assessments as applications are created, deployed and scaled.

In this talk we'll walk through a straightforward example of building up a container "client" written in Go, using today's containerd client library and API. Similar to how the Kubernetes CRI uses the containerd endpoints or how the Docker engine's libcontainerd operates, our small client will have access to all the same capabilities of container lifecycle management and registry interactions provided by containerd.  To finish our tour of building a fully functioning containerd client, we will pair our new sample application with LinuxKit and the Moby tool project. Using these tools, we'll build a simple virtual machine that embeds containerd and our sample client to test interesting aspects of containerd's capabilities in our own customized Linux OS image."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017 11:55amüWednesday December  6, 2017 1 12:30pmüBallroom B, Level 1

Boxcar was developed in 2010 and provides built-in advantages when used with Indeed’s infrastructure. This framework was originally built as a proof of concept and only targeted Java as a supported language. Due to this limitation, it has not scaled with Indeed’s growth and adoption of more and more languages. Recently, Indeed has started to experiment with gRPC as a replacement for the framework. In this talk, we’ll describe our existing service infrastructure and the changes we made in order to support gRPC. We’ll also discuss the strategy we used to migrate existing Boxcar services over to using gRPC. Finally, we’ll compare benchmarks between Boxcar and the new gRPC-based system. Other technologies mentioned in the talk: linkerd for load balancing, opentracing."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017 11:55amüWednesday December  6, 2017 1 12:30pmüMeeting Room 10AB, Level 3

These platforms have thousands of tenants and run atop hundreds of thousands of servers, across on-prem & the public cloud. The scale & diversity in multi-tenant infrastructure services makes it extremely difficult to effectively forecast capacity, compute resource utilization & cost and drive efficiency.  In this talk, I would like to share how my team is building a system (Kite - A unified service manager) to help define, model, provision, meter & charge infrastructure resources. The infrastructure resources include primitive bare metal servers / VMs on the public cloud and abstract resources offered by multi-tenant services such as our Compute platform (powered by Apache Aurora/Mesos), Storage (Manhattan for key/val, Cache, RDBMS), Observability. Along with how we solved this problem, I also intend to share a few case-studies on how we were able to use this data to better plan capacity & drive a cultural change in engineering that helped improve overall resource utilization & drive significant savings in infrastructure spend."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017 11:55amüWednesday December  6, 2017 1 12:30pmüMeeting Room 6AB, Level 3
ee665195428e05c597d459e043f89102üThe Power of Application Intent Analysis for Container Security [I]üPolicy + Security - CloudNativeConü"As containers gain mainstream momentum and cloud-native applications surge, practices such as DevOps culture, continuous delivery, cloud development and containerization require a reinvention of security. The threats targeting organizations only continue to increase in severity and frequency, and even simple attacks can cause considerable damage. Cloud-native development is a vital evolution for security in the enterprise, as it equips organizations with the same tools and processes that modern fast-moving organizations rely on.   Cloud-native needs to be considered a new culture, not just a technological shift, when it comes to IT. This is because cloud-native changes the processes of DevOps, which requires automated security processes and application awareness. With cloud-native culture, security needs to be truly application aware and based upon developer intent. Using application intent analysis, developers have a new way of looking at applications, specifically containerized apps. They can produce produce a more predictable and secure container environment that can be effectively enforced.  The unique nature of container technology allows the developer intent-based security model to capitalize on the following pillars:   1. Containers are declarative. When a developer writes the code, he/she does not just write the code, he/she writes a manifest that describes how this code should work and how it should interact with its environment. While the developer does not provide you with a real security manifest, you can translate the extra information that you have and try to create a security profile. With containers, you have a Docker file, you might have a pod, and you might have an application group if you’re running on top of mesosphere. There is a lot of information in the system that you could use in order to understand what is supposed to happen.  2. Containers are predictable. When you look at containers, they contain less specific logic and more common building blocks because containers are typically made out of downloadable layers that someone else created.   3. Containers are immutable. In the past, it was hard to understand if something happening with the application was really an attack or not. But in the case of containers, whenever you patch a container or change its real intent, it should not happen in real time. What happens is the developer changes things and then he/she pushes in a new version. He patches the OS or adds new functionality and then pushes in a new container and scratches the old one. This gives you a lot of power from a security standpoint because, for the first time ever, if you see a polymorphic change in the behavior of the application (if it starts behaving differently) that means it’s either a configuration drift or a real attack.  By leveraging these three pillars -- declarative nature, predictability and immutability -- there’s a powerful opportunity to use whitelisting, for example, to approve known good processes. In combination with application intent analysis, enforcement measures help support the intent-based security model and preserve the original intent of the application."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017 11:55amüWednesday December  6, 2017 1 12:30pmüMeeting Room 5ABC, Level 3

A visual discovery engine at heart, Pinterest guides you through a billion possibilities to quickly discover & get inspired to do something. With over 150MM MAUs across the globe contributing & combing through a billion pins, Pinterest's Infrastructure is built to cater to this scale with very unique requirements -- Today, I'll be talking about how a company operating on the public cloud on VMs since its inception decided to move to containers.  This talk will primarily focus on four things: 1. Pinterest Infrastructure Overview (Offline Compute / Online Serving) Pinterest was born on AWS. As of today, we operate tens and thousands of instances and process tens and hundreds of PBs of data. Data is the cornerstone of our business where freshness & relevance is key. We will deep dive into our processing & serving stack.  2. VMs vs. Containers - The Pros and Cons In this section, we will cover the challenges along four key pillars:  a. Developer Velocity - We will discuss the overall job lifecycle workflow i.e build, setup, deploy, operations when using VMs or Containers. b. Service Reliability - Constraints around resource isolation and standardization across health checks.  c. Infrastructure Governance - Attribution of resources both on utilization & Spend, Quotas d. Efficiency - Specifically around auto scaling -- our learnings from using ASGs at scale & how this impacts VM vs. Container from an efficiency & operations perspective.  3. Move to Containers Here we will discuss the use of Docker at Pinterest and more importantly the steps we took around evaluating various orchestration systems. I'll share the various dimensions we evaluated and our learnings when running on a public cloud environment. For ex, docker integration, scheduling, networking, community, stateful support, big data support, security support  4.

In the face of highly dynamic compute and network resources, a new challenge has risen: how to authenticate and secure service-to-service traffic in this brave new world? Enter the problem known as service identity.  Getting service identity right is surprisingly hard, with requirements extending well beyond simple secret management. What kind of credentials to settle on, how to rotate them, how to automatically (and securely) bootstrap them... and even more importantly, how to make sure a wide variety of external systems can authenticate them appropriately? These questions represent only a subset of the points that must be solved for.  In this talk, we introduce both SPIFFE and SPIRE - a new open source project designed to solve exactly these problems. SPIRE, backed by the SPIFFE open standard, performs seamless node and workload attestation across various platforms, and automatically issue short-lived certificates based on those attestations in a controlled manner. Even better, these certificates work across organizational boundaries and heterogeneous environments thanks to SPIFFE, which introduces a standardized identity format and validation methodology for X.509 certificates."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017  2:00pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   2:35pmüMeeting Room 5ABC, Level 3

Complexity is the enemy of security.  This heterogeneity is its embodiment. Having many different ways to configure access policies on different cloud providers or with different vendors, makes it impossible to understand whom has access to what in any given infrastructure.  Without this visibility it is impossible to have intelligibility, and hence security.  
Worse, today developers and operators must exist in and support a highly dynamic service environment.  That is to say existing services must evolve to support new functionality, and new services must be rapidly brought on line to support features in a highly competitive business environment.  The miasma of different configuration schemes creates a great deal of friction against this, and impedes security because it is difficult to holistically understand the impact of changes (let alone make them rapidly).  Security must be able to accommodate this temporality.
In this talk we introduce PADME as an architecture for policy admission aimed at solving these problems in a distributed environment.  PADME operates by normalizing access policy information across underlying clouds and system.  It allows policies to be operated up as known fixed building blocks in order to establish end to end security.  Finally, it attacks the problem of policy distribution in a distributed environment so that assertions can be made about the security of a system over time, and in the face of CAP theorem issues."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017  2:45pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   3:20pmüMeeting Room 5ABC, Level 3

NGINX, the leading provider of ingress controller functionality in Kubernetes environments, has partnered with Istio to enhance Sidecar proxy capabilities in the Istio' Services Mesh architecture.   A service mesh is highly dependent on the strength of the proxy, and NGINX is the most powerful service proxy in the market. It offers a small footprint high performance engine with advance load balancing algorithms, caching, SSL termination, API gateway, extensibility through broad range of third-party modules, sciptability with Lau and nginScript and various security features with granular access control.   Microservices also require a Web Server to be deployed side-by-side with the service proxy. While optional, deploying NGINX as Web Server technology provides additional benefits in performance, manageability, security and the overall monitoring of the Application.   NGINX is already used by more than half of the top 100,000 websites and this talk will describe how NGINX in Istio environments is a natural extension of this technology.   Our demo will show a sample application running in a Kubernetes/Istio/NGINX environment and we will answer questions from the audience."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017  2:45pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   3:20pmüMeeting Room 9C, Level 3

Its goal is to be a stable container runtime tied to kubernetes releases, replacing the docker daemon.  Historically every update of Docker has broken Kubernetes. This has led to major rewriting and fixes of Kubernetes, which is understandable since Docker is not primarily for Kubernetes. Kubernetes needs a container runtime dedicated to its specifications.   CRI-O, the name comes from the Container Runtime Interface for Open container runtimes, takes advantages of emerging standards like OCI Runtime and Image Specification, as well as open source projects to handle container images (github.com:containers/image, github.com:containers/storage) . This means as these projects advance CRI-O will be able to take advantage of the improvements and features, but all the while guaranteeing that it will not break any functionality required by the Kubernetes CRI. CRI-O works with runc and Clear Containers runtimes.   CRI-O was designed from the ground up to satisfy Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface, and currently passes all node and E2E tests. The github repository has been setup to not accept any pull requests that causes these tests to break. We will be tying the versions of CRI-O to the Kubernetes versions, to maintain complete compatibility.  This talk will describe the CRI-O architecture as well as demonstrate different kubernetes features running on top of CRI-O exercising the CRI API. The attendees will learn how to configure CRI-O with kubernetes and use it for their workloads."üAnyüWednesday December  6, 2017  3:40pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   4:15pmüBallroom B, Level 1

In 2017, Netflix is recognized as one of the industry leaders at building and operating “cloud native” systems at scale. Like many organizations, Netflix has unique security requirements for many of their workloads. This variety requires a holistic approach to authorization to address “who can do what” across a range of resources, enforcement points, and execution environments.  In this talk, Manish Mehta (Senior Security Software Engineer at Netflix) and Torin Sandall (Technical Lead of the Open Policy Agent project) will present how Netflix is solving authorization across the stack in cloud native environments. The presentation shows how Netflix enforces authorization decisions at scale across various kinds of resources (e.g., HTTP APIs, gRPC methods, SSH), enforcement points (e.g., microservices, proxies, host-level daemons), and execution environments (e.g., VMs, containers) without introducing unreasonable latency. The presentation includes a deep dive into the architecture of the cloud native authorization system at Netflix as well as how authorization decisions can be offloaded to an open source, general-purpose policy engine (Open Policy Agent).  This talk is targeted at engineers building and operating cloud native systems who are interested in security and authorization. The audience can expect to take away fresh ideas about how to enforce fine-grained authorization policies across stackthe cloud environment."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017  3:40pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   4:15pmüBallroom A, Level 1

In practice, it's still hard to take observed metrics, and translate them into quantitative predictions about what will happen to service performance as load changes. Resource limits are often chosen by guesstimation, and teams are likely to find themselves reacting to slowdowns and bottlenecks, rather than anticipating them.   Queueing theory can help, by treating large-scale software systems as mathematical models. But it's not easy to translate between real-world systems and textbook models. This talk will cover practical techniques for turning operational data into actionable predictions. We'll show how to use results from queueing theory to develop a model of system performance. We'll discuss what data to gather in production to better inform its predictions -- for example, why it's important to capture the shape of a latency distribution, and not just a few percentiles. We'll also talk about some of the limitations and pitfalls of performance modelling."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017  3:40pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   4:15pmüMeeting Room 6AB, Level 3
8432f0ed384616af6d14947f2cac900füBuilding an Edge Computing Platform for Network Services Using Cloud Native Technology [I]üServices - CloudNativeConü"Edge computing have become increasingly important due to the demands of latency sensitive applications and explosion of data from end user devices in cases such as Internet of Things (IoT). One common intelligent edge deployment is the buildout of mini data centers on network edge that are centrally managed and operated by the cloud. Unlike traditional data centers, these mini data centers are constrained by limited resources and minimal operational supervision, and as such they impose challenges on traditional data center infrastructure including network services, here defined as L3-7 network services such as packet gateway and application firewall. These services usually are implemented with the need for heavy manual configurations and complex provisioning, which are particularly ill-fitted to deploy at the edge.  In this session we will discuss how we built a new edge computing platform for network services that can achieve auto provisioning, dynamic service deployments and updates, and high resiliency. By running componentized network services in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, and utilizing projects such as gRPC, linkerd, and fluentd, as well as making use of cloud native related projects including etcd and IOvisor, this platform essentially treats network services as cloud native applications, and thereby able to achieve the associated benefits. We will show a demo of the platform as part of the presentation."üIntermediateüWednesday December  6, 2017  3:40pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   4:15pmüMeeting Room 9C, Level 3

What's less well understood is how to do it for thousands of services running on behalf of hundreds of possibly competing customers, in particular how to do it securely, protect the privacy of each customer, and support binary protocols other than HTTP. This is the problem that our company solved for our SaaS business which requires hosting and operating the control plane of popular infrastructure management software (e.g. Openstack, Big Data, and Kubernetes itself) as a service for our customers. Those control planes contain services exposing protocols as varied as MySQL and AMQP. This talk describes the challenges we faced and how we solved them using multiple technologies from the Kubernetes ecosystem. The solution includes a system that automatically creates namespaces, provisions certificate hierarchies, and manages ingress controllers for new customers, then wraps services with a set of side-car containers to handle tasks such as TLS termination. We describe how we employed Kubernetes native constructs such as Custom Resource Definitions to automate those tasks. For network communications, we discuss how to securely handle ingress, outgress, pod-to-pod, and cross-namespace traffic. To support both HTTP and TCP-based protocols, we describe a two-level network routing system consisting of both a "k8sniff" and an nginx ingress controller. For ensuring customer data privacy we compare these approaches: (1) Network Policy + Layer 2 virtualization; (2) TLS encryption of all pod-to-pod traffic; (3) a combination of the two. Finally, we debate whether the process isolation model of Linux containers is sufficient, and discuss our experience with stronger virtualization-based mechanisms such as Frakti / HyperContainer."üAdvancedüWednesday December  6, 2017  4:25pmüWednesday December  6, 2017   5:00pmüMeeting Room 5ABC, Level 3

It is emerging not only as a way to not only solve hard problems deploying and running applications, but is supporting the development of new approaches to building and running applications that power the world.  
 During this session, Craig McLuckie, one of the Kubernetes founders and CEO of Heptio will look ahead to the coming years and talk about some important trends in the ecosystem that will continue to support and drive the success of the project. We will focus on the emergence of expert operations and talk about how Kubernetes is starting to change the organizations that build and manage distributed systems. This will touch on how SRE values are starting to find their way into modern development teams, what tools are still needed to drive ops maturity and the overall value of this trend to companies adopting cloud native technologies. We will discuss the value of continued focus on modularity and extensibility in the cloud native ecosystem as a way to foster innovation in the ecosystem, and also discuss the the emerging role Kubernetes is playing in the increasingly heterogeneous world of cloud."ühttps://youtu.be/3FR82H7NwAwüThursday December  7, 2017 10:20amüThursday December  7, 2017 1 10:40amüExhibit Hall 3, Level 1

7e7adefae35cd7fae5d8464f5bda8fb2üThe Road to More Usable KubernetesüAppOps/AppDev - KubeCon   Featured Sessionü"At KubeCon EU, in Berlin, I got up on stage and stated that "Kubernetes Sucks (but all software sucks)". While we still have work to do, in the past several months the community has done great work to solve a whole host of issues to make Kubernetes “suck less.” In this talk I will outline the ways that the community has made this happen both in the core project and in the wider ecosystem.  Things are still developing, but here are the areas that I want to highlight. Hopefully we'll have talks on many of these so that I can highlight where and when folks can find out more. I won't be able to cover everything happening in the ecosystem but I can hint at the diversity and commitment to solving these issues.  * *Simpler application description.* As a community we are continuing to build more tcapable and simpler tools for describing applications through projects like ksonnet, OpenCompose, Kompose, and Helm. * *Serverless platforms.* Through “function as a service” like systems we can abstract much of the nitty gritty around getting code packaged and running. In addition, scaling can be easy and automatic as code is run only when needed. * *Simpler cluster install and admin.* kubeadm and how it is becoming a common toolkit. Similar work is ongoing to explore the idea of standardizing the description of a cluster at the infrastructure level through projects like Kubicorn. In addition, new APIs, such as the certificates API, are key building blocks for getting secure clusters up and running. * *Curated development experiences.* Systems like Draft help to automate the build/launch/update cycle for development workflows. Others are also exploring ways to connect developers to clusters. * *Making Kubernetes boring.* Kubernetes is maturing as a platform. As that happens, things in the "nucleus" are slowing down. In the past 6 months we've seen a concerted effort to encourage new features to be built with extensibility mechanisms as much as possible. This allows those projects to move fast while enabling exploration of the problem space. * *Conformance.* Another key enabler for widespread Kubernetes adoption is conformance. There has been a wide set of folks involved in describing what should get to be called "Kubernetes". Tools like Sonobuoy point the direction to making this be an automated process that anyone can run against any cluster. * *Observability.* Prometheus continues to be the go-to OSS solution for monitoring in the Kubernetes world. In additions, systems like linkerd and Istio/envoy enable introspection at the microservice mesh level.  We still have many challenges. Many of these are going to take long concerted efforts to fix. We are trapped, in some ways, by our promise of backward compatibility. It is often better to live with something annoying than to force breaking changes on our user base.  *Call to action:* Great job community! But the job isn't done. Let's keep working hard to bring Kubernetes to a larger and larger set of users and environments."üAnyüThursday December  7, 2017 11:10amüThursday December  7, 2017 1 11:45amüBallroom A, Level 1

We start the talk with a brief summary of the state of infrastructure today and explain the differences between “infrastructure as code” and “infrastructure as software”. We look at how the lack of definition in the most fundamental layer of the stack has fragmented our community and caused problems with adoption of Kubernetes.   We propose a new way of representing infrastructure (the cluster API) for the Kubernetes community and take a deep dive into its implementation in kubicorn. We look at the structure of the cluster API and share valuable insight on how we took lessons from other areas of Kubernetes to form what it is today. Furthermore we look at the power of having a declarative approach to infrastructure as we start to treat the infrastructure layer the same as the application layer.  The audience will walk away with a clear understanding of the infrastructure layer, as well as a new way of thinking about the infrastructure in the future via the cluster API."üAdvancedüThursday December  7, 2017 11:10amüThursday December  7, 2017 1 11:45amüMeeting Room 8ABC, Level 3

With so many different components working together it can be hard to know how the pieces work together or where new products and features fit in. I will start at the highest level and then peel off the layers one at time to explain how some of the "magic" happens. Over the course of the presentation I will break Kubernetes into the following layers:  "Kubernetes for the End User": A quick summary on some of the core components of Kubernetes: Namespaces, Deployments, Pods, Services, and Ingress Rules. At this layer the user just needs to understand the promises made by Kubernetes, not necessarily the way it keeps them. This layer primarily serves to establish a typical cluster workload. The resources defined here will be used when explaining all of the deeper layers.  "Kubernetes for the Cluster Admin": This Layer peels away some of the cluster "Magic". I will cover how the service account, default tokens, ReplicaSet and Pods from the previous layer got created by the kube-controller-manager. I will also explain how the kube-scheduler decided which node the workload should run on and how that decision could have been influenced by fields in the pod spec. This section will touch on the core concepts of Ingress controllers, Admission Controllers, scheduling, and core controller loops.   "Kubernetes for the Cloud Admin": This layer covers Kubernetes at an infrastructure level. Core concepts covered are: Horizontal Scaling, Load Balancing, high availability for masters and nodes, node management, and fault-tolerance levels. Here is also where I set the stage for the network layer that is covered next.  "Kubernetes for the Network Admin": Now we dig deeper into the network infrastructure. Explaining how pods and services work together, how your network traffic figures out where to go, and how it gets there. This section covers the concepts of East-West and North-South load balancing. The goal is to provide an basic understanding of the network promises made by Kubernetes and how you might replace them with other software and services.  "Kubernetes for the Linux Admin": A discussion of Kubernetes at the OS layer. This layer digs into the processes and configuration of the base OS. This includes pluggable container engines ex: Docker vs. Rkt, logging, CNI, metric gathering and volume mounting.  "Kubernetes for the Power-User": Time permitting, the final section will put all of the previous ones together to show how a next-generation application might be deployed on top of Kubernetes and take advantage of the more advanced features."üIntermediateüThursday December  7, 2017 11:10amüThursday December  7, 2017 1 11:45amüMeeting Room 19AB, Level 4

Tools like kubicorn and kubeadm are likely the foundation on which Kubernetes deployments will be performed in the future as they help simplify the deployment and operations of Kubernetes a very complex distributed system.   However concerns about security and compliance, which are not as yet addressed by those tools, may act as inhibitors and road blocks to using these them and thus Kubernetes in the enterprise.  Thankfully the techniques and tools for deploying Enterprise Linux distributions, securing them, and ensuring compliance already exist and can be very easily combined with kubernetes.  In this talk we’ll expand upon these enterprise requirements and use cases and show how we can use existing Ansible tooling to deploy kubernetes on bare metal or the cloud, monitor it with common enterprise monitoring tools, secure it with a 2fa SSH bastion, and ensure [DISA STIG] compliance."üIntermediateüThursday December  7, 2017 11:10amüThursday December  7, 2017 1 11:45amüMeeting Room 12AB, Level 4

874ea1691e571524690abc5d3f54c4f7üSquash: A Debugger for Kubernetes AppsüAppOps/AppDev - KubeConü"Squash is a tool for debugging distributed applications.  Most cloud native applications written today follow the microservice architecture. These applications are distributed by nature, and therefore hard to debug.  Microservice engineers debug their applications by printing values of select variables into log files. This leaves them with the daunting task of sorting through reams of log data, which at best provide a partial view of the state of application. This approach is cumbersome, time consuming and works better with "easy" bugs.  Many advanced tools to debug monolitic applications exist in the market, and provide users with powerful ways to dissect their programs and to interact with them on the fly. However, these tools cannot be used directly for debugging applications that follow the microservice architecture pattern.  Squash is designed to bring the strength of modern debuggers and the convenience of their IDEs to microservices developers. Squash uses popular, powerful and mature debuggers (gdb, dlv, java debugging) and integrates them seamlessly with Kubernetes. This allows devs to use the debugger of their choice, and the IDEs that support it, to develop microservices on any platform."üAnyüThursday December  7, 2017 11:55amüThursday December  7, 2017 1 12:30pmüMeeting Room 10AB, Level 3

Like other organizations, the IHME have embraced containers and micro-services aggressively to better support hundreds of collaborating researchers. In addition to containerized workloads, the IHME run a wide-variety of traditional analytic, simulation and high-performance computing workloads on an HPC cluster with 15,000 cores and 13PB of storage. Researchers increasingly need to combine both containerized and non-containerized elements into workflow pipelines, and a key challenge has been ensuring SLAs for various departments and avoiding duplicate infrastructure and unnecessary data movement and duplication. In collaboration with industry partners, IHME have deployed a unique solution based on Univa’s Navops technology that allows them to combine containerized and traditional analytic and high-performance application workloads on a single shared Kubernetes cluster, ensuring departmental SLAs and helping contain infrastructure costs.

With OpenFaaS you can package any process or container as a serverless function for either Linux or Windows - just bring your Kubernetes or Docker cluster. Avoid vendor lock-in by running functions in your own datacenter or the cloud with your existing CI/CD and container ecosystem. The project focuses on ease of use through its UI and CLI which can be used to test and monitor functions in tandem with Prometheus integration that enables auto-scaling as demand increases.
You can deploy OpenFaaS in 60 seconds on Kubernetes and thanks to concise code templates all you need to write is a handler in your favourite programming language then let your cluster do the heavy lifting.

OpenFaaS was recently trending as the top open-source project on GitHub, won Best Cloud Computing Software 2017 from InfoWorld and has a thriving community with 65 contributors, 1400 commits and over 8k stars.

29aad2a67a389f1630026b2406a1958büWG Multitenancy Deep DiveüCommunity/SIGü"Kubernetes has supported "soft" multitenancy since the beginning, with features such as namespaces, ResourceQuota, and resource-based scheduling. Over the years Kubernetes has added a number of sophisticated features to strengthen its multitenancy support, for example RBAC, PodSecuityPolicy, NetworkPolicy, priority/preemption, etc.
Now is a good time to take stock of Kubernetes' multitenancy support from the perspective of different types of users -- for example small organizations where everyone trusts each other, large enterprises that need isolation between many internal teams and applications sharing a cluster, SaaS providers hosting instances of their SaaS for many users in a single cluster, and infrastructure providers offering hosted "Kubernetes as a Service" -- and ask what are the key gaps remaining to be filled. Do we need hierarchical namespaces? Better mechanisms to hide shared resources so users can't see who they're sharing the cluster with? Multitenancy policies (quota, RBAC, etc.) that span namespaces, or that apply to a label-selected subset of objects within a namespace? Split-horizon DNS? Resource scheduling within the control plane to ensure no tenant monopolizes the API server, controllers, scheduler, etc.? Where on the spectrum from "soft multitenancy" to "hard multitenancy" should Kubernetes aim (and what do these terms mean, anyway?)

In this session we will discuss what multitenancy means to us as a community, and where we should focus our multitenancy efforts in 2018."üüThursday December  7, 2017  2:00pmüThursday December  7, 2017   3:20pmüMeeting Room 4BC, Level 3

In computing, we have similar guides for various technologies. Python offers “The Zen Of Python”, Ruby has “The Rails Doctrine”, and so on...  One of the powers these documents wield is that they help serve as a “north star” that guides an entire community toward the same goals.  I believe we need a similar guide for Kubernetes. It would describe how app developers and operators should think about and use the features in Kubernetes to build and deploy reliable, stable apps. Armed with such a guide, we could all hope to better understand the “essence” of Kubernetes in pursuit of building better cloud native apps.  We don’t have anything like this today, but many in the Kubernetes community have strong, detailed opinions for what should go in this guide. Much of it is tribal knowledge or scattered in blog posts.   In this talk, I’ll try to bring many of these opinions together and lay out an “Elements of Kubernetes” guide for app developers and operators alike.

Well, not quite: there are still some important unknowns to understand before your service will be ready for production traffic. It's still unclear how the new service behaves when it's being pushed, and it's possible that Kubernetes will kill the service before serving a single request. At Buffer, we've developed a technique to optimize Kubernetes deployment limits by using load testing to identify optimal values for resource limits. When the service is under heavy load there are a few key metrics to watch to identify bottlenecks. These key metrics can be used to adjust resource limits. This real world approach allowed us to safely and efficiently switch over more than half our production traffic to our Kubernetes cluster and can be applied to any application.

At UC Berkeley, we are trying - our 'Foundations of Data Science' course has no pre-requisites, and routinely attracts more than a 1000 students from across majors. 
Requiring students to have local programming environments installed & debugged is a non-starter at this scale. We have been running a Kubernetes based JupyterHub environment that allows them to do all their programming with a web based environment with Jupyter Notebooks. This is an important change in many ways:
1. Lets students start instantly with writing code, rather than dealing with the accidental complexity of installing software locally
2. Acts as an equalizer - a student using a chromebook borrowed from the library has no disadvantage over someone using an expensive Macbook Pro
3. This is course critical infrastructure, and needs high availability at low human / dollar cost
In this talk we'll go over how we have:
1. Used Kubernetes to make reduce our costs while allowing a larger group of people to deploy safely to various cloud providers.
2. Extracted our JupyterHub deployment into a project part of Project Jupyter (Zero to JupyterHub) that is being adopted at other universities & organizations."üAnyüThursday December  7, 2017  3:50pmüThursday December  7, 2017   4:25pmüBallroom B, Level 1

This provides better utilization of resources and enables our service developers to write serverless functions with simple declarations. Kubernetes provides Jobs and Deployments as design constructs to handle such needs, while other frameworks like IronIO Functions, Fabric8, et al aim to solve end-to-end use case . However, we had to extend on top of Kubernetes Jobs & Deployments to define the packaging and I/O interactions of the function, implement a priority queue for execution, and provide declarative retry policy while ensuring high availability. A developer 'writes' a function supporting common EAI patterns for start time parameterized variables, and defines it's packaging and scheduling using a yaml file. The framework then packages it as a Container alongwith an 'observer' container in a pod, 'registers' it with the scheduler while ensuring choice of 'warm' vs on-demand requisite replicas of the pod, and then through a 'Scalar' manages the execution and life cycle of job, while logging and tracing failures/success.

Mainly through the power of copy and paste we all get our first examples working. But as usage of Kubernetes grows, spanning teams and time, we build up a lot of those YAML files. Many people reach for templating, or look at higher-level tooling like Helm packages next. But catching errors is still mainly a manual process of running the resulting configuration against a working Kubernetes cluster.  In this talk we’ll look at what’s missing in this workflow, looking for inspiration from developer tooling from other languages and frameworks. In particular we’ll consider:  * Ways of providing feedback about invalid configuration in our text editors * Validating configuration against the Kubernetes types, especially useful when generating that configuration from templates * Checking Kubernetes configuration is valid for different versions of Kubernetes * What unit testing our Kubernetes configuration looks like * How to integrate all of this together into a continuous integration based workflow  We’ll show examples using straight YAML files, templating and higher-level tooling like Helm and Jsonnet.

It assumes that you have one or more machine available and those machines can connect to each other via the network.  The master plan is to make kubeadm work both as the “fast path” to getting a best-practice Kubernetes cluster with a couple of easy-to-remember commands and as a toolbox for higher-level solutions like GKE, kops and Tectonic.  But how does kubeadm actually set up a cluster? How is it so easy to add a node with the Bootstrap Token? How does it self-host the control plane? How does it upgrade clusters smoothly with only one command? What is the plan for achieving HA without relying on any external infrastructure?  After this talk, you will be able to describe how: 

kubeadm runs the different tasks in different stages
the network traffic between the cluster components flow
self-hosting of the control plane works
the Bootstrap Token works
the `kubeadm upgrade` command works

In this talk, we will discuss the various cluster security models available today, and how to use namespaces to provide tenant isolation. We will also demonstrate how to use Kubernetes’ Role Based Access Control (RBAC) feature as means of enforcing a multi-tenant security model. By assigning roles and role bindings and creating namespaces, we can implement restrictions on resource consumption and provide tenant isolation throughout the cluster. We’ll also demonstrate how the RBAC feature provides granularity of access control that can be adjusted to suit varying requirements—from granting full access to users or groups to a cluster to only granting access to specific resources within a namespace.

What happened to appc? Do I need to do anything to take advantage? Don’t we already have container runtimes? So, why do we need CRI? Similarly, what’s the use of CNI with all of the container networking solutions already out there?  Our aim is to answer all of these questions, and showcase places you can find (and use!) each of them. We’ll discuss how these specs affect you when using Kubernetes or other container orchestrated projects. Kubernetes will serve as a handy vehicle for some short, live demos. We’ll explore how each standard is improving our lives today, and what kinds of innovation they open up for the future."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017 11:10amüFriday December  8, 2017 1 11:45amüMeeting Room 19AB, Level 4
f7df7cd4babf5e8c3b37f74e4bbb025büA Scheduling Simulator for Capacity Estimation of Kubernetes ClustersüAppOps/AppDev - KubeConü"Capacity planning is very important for meeting dynamic demands in any clusters. Without having an approximate view of the remaining capacity in a cluster, it is hard for cluster operators to decide if and when the cluster should be provisioned with more capacity or not. In Kubernetes clusters, capacity is associated with worker nodes in terms of resources such as cpu, memory or storage. Discussing capacity in terms of individual resources may be a bit ambiguous because a Pod is the smallest schedulable unit in Kubernetes clusters. Therefore, cluster operators may be more interested in knowing an approximate number of pods of a specific size (amount of resources) that can be scheduled on a cluster. This talk will introduce a new tool, called cluster capacity, that can be used to analyze the capacity of a Kubernetes cluster in this way. First, the talk will discuss about its use cases, followed by its design and implementation as a scheduling simulator. The talk will also include a demo to demonstrate various ways the tool can be run against a Kubernetes cluster. This talk will conclude with the discussion of future directions for this tool."üAnyüFriday December  8, 2017 11:10amüFriday December  8, 2017 1 11:45amüMeeting Room 10AB, Level 3

OSS users by nature want to roll their own on premises, and use best-of-breed services in public clouds an without lock-in. Fortunately, Kubernetes runs everywhere so developers and operators don't need to learn new technologies to run hybrid and multi-cloud applications. In this talk, we will demonstrate the use of two new extensibility features in Kubernetes to connect legacy on-premises applications and managed public cloud services with services running on Kubernetes in both places, creating an environment where users can have the best of all worlds. We will show the type of use cases this technology enables using examples from Google's cloud platform."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017 11:10amüFriday December  8, 2017 1 11:45amüMeeting Room 8ABC, Level 3

These solutions require a generic cluster scheduling layer to host multiple workloads such as Kafka, Spark and TensorFlow, alongside databases such as Cassandra, Elasticsearch and cloud-based storage.   Eliran Bivas is a senior big data architect with years of hands-on experience working on both big data and cloud native solutions. Eliran will go over a common solution framework to create cloud native end-to-end analytics applications. It involves using Kubernetes as an alternative to Yarn, running Spark, Presto, machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Python and Spark ML kits) and serverless functions coupled with local and cloud-based storage. The session will showcase customer use-cases from IoT, automotive, cloud SaaS and finance. It will also include a live solution demo which demonstrates the benefits of using big data and analytics over a cloud native architecture, eliminating the existing challenges of complexity and moving towards a continuous integration and development architecture for big data."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017 11:10amüFriday December  8, 2017 1 11:45amüMeeting Room 9C, Level 3

Eight months later, a small team of three operations engineers had migrated our first microservice from Mesos to Kubernetes. All without developers making any code changes. This was possible by architecting our applications with the proper set of abstractions. Fast-forward three months later and we have almost 20 microservices running on Kubernetes in production.  In this session, we’ll do a live demo of migrating a service from Mesos to Kubernetes, just like how we did it at Hootsuite! We will cover why architecting your infrastructure with the “right” abstractions helps you do these huge migrations with ease and how Kubernetes already contains these abstractions. We will explore how having a service mesh helps routing between two platforms while doing the migration. Also, how a mature CI/CD pipeline can help you deploy to two platforms with ease. To conclude we will explore the differences in running a service in Mesos and Kubernetes."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017 11:10amüFriday December  8, 2017 1 11:45amüBallroom B, Level 1

Rolling updates in Kubernetes is a really good example of how real-time updates to applications can be made reliable, without any downtime. Once you have a reliable system, you then need to make your software development process even more efficient. A key component in efficiency is automation. Automated builds on Docker cloud are a great way to efficiently build images when new code is pushed. In this talk we will discuss how we can take automation one step further. We will make use of the Kuberbnetes API calls, along with Docker Hub's webhooks feature, to automatically start rolling updates of deployments when a new image/tag is pushed to Docker Hub. We will demonstrate how you can write a micro-service that will make these calls after consuming the data pushed by Docker Hub's webhook."üBeginnerüFriday December  8, 2017 11:55amüFriday December  8, 2017 1 12:30pmüMeeting Room 10AB, Level 3

We encountered significant challenges in our transition to a microservice-based architecture. Each new service increased the operations burden to provision and maintain a growing fleet of servers, frequently slowing the process of adding new services and scaling existing services in our datacenters.  I’ll discuss how we used Kubernetes to containerize our microservice ecosystem and solve those challenges. To effectively work with ephemeral Kubernetes pods, we replaced Graphite with Prometheus and Sensu with AlertManager to monitor service health rather than individual instances. We discovered massive performance issues containerizing our Java services and worked around JVM complexities. To ease our transition from virtualization to containerization, services running inside and outside of Kubernetes must seamlessly discover each other with Consul and communicate with each other.

As Kubernetes matures, extensibility has become a critical feature that organizations can leverage to enforce their organization’s bespoke policies.  In this talk, Torin explains how to use extensibility features in Kubernetes (e.g., External Admission Control) to enforce custom policies over workloads.

Traditionally, the uncertainty of SPIs (they can be terminated at any time due to price fluctuations) have made managing them tricky, and restricted them to specific workloads and use cases. Kubernetes, in contrast, not only handles node failure very well, it has trained developers and architects to design applications to tolerate and even embrace failure. The prospect of Kubernetes abstracting the complexities of SPIs is now a reality, enabling applications to take advantage of low-cost compute across different clouds and possibly vendors. The purpose of this talk is to educate the audience on strategies for making the most out of this powerful combination. Specifically, we will discuss these topics: 1. What are spot bidding strategies, and what is their cost vs. predictability trade-off? 2. What class of Kubernetes applications would benefit the most from SPIs? 3. Available Kubernetes mechanisms (e.g taints/tolerations, affinity, availability zones) for placing applications based on their tolerance with SPIs 3. Implementation strategies (e.g. blending multiple autoscaling groups to satisfy both SPI-optimized applications vs. applications that are more mission-critical or stateful) 4. What out-of-the box solutions exist, either free or commercial? 5. How to take abstract away clouds from different regions and vendors, allowing workloads to always take advantage of the best available pricing?  The talk concludes with real-world test results involving multiple use cases and configurations, giving the audience an idea of the potential cost savings and trade-offs (if any) of combining Kubernetes and SPIs."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017  2:00pmüFriday December  8, 2017   2:35pmüMeeting Room 8ABC, Level 3

Given a highly salable and distributed microservices deployment is going to face failures at different layers, how do we make these microservices resilient and fault tolerant? How do we enforce policy decisions such as fine-grained access control and rate limits? How do we enabled timeouts/retries, health checks etc? Even though some language specific frameworks address these issues, the implementation is often framework or language specific.   If the underlying framework or language changes, the resiliency features need to be reimplemented or ported over. And in some cases, applications also have the responsibility of implementing the code and configuration required for resiliency and fault tolerance. A Service-mesh architecture attempts to solve these issues by extracting the common resiliency features needed by a microservice framework away from the applications and frameworks and into the platform itself. Istio provides an easy way to create this service mesh.  In this talk we will discuss how to build, deploy, connect your Java microservices leveraging Istio service mesh. We then show how to configure and use circuit breakers, timeouts/retries, rate limits and other advanced resiliency features from Istio without changing the application code."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017  3:40pmüFriday December  8, 2017   4:15pmüMeeting Room 9AB, Level 3

For a platform at this scale, it is critical to have a powerful and flexible ingress routing layer (controller) that is able to handle the dynamic behavior of container based applications, such as auto-scaling, frequently changing pod IP addresses, self-serve onboarding and cluster-aware routing. This L7 routing layer must be quick to react to changes on the cluster without affecting its routing capabilities and impacting the in-flight requests. In a multi-tenant system it is even more vital that a single application deployment does not cause an impact to user traffic or hinder the release velocity of other tenants.   We developed an ingress controller based on Apache Traffic Server that satisfies the requirements stated above, while remaining scalable and easy to integrate with both Kubernetes and the Oath ecosystem.

The route we chose diverged from the never ending landscape of single purpose YAML tutorials and retreading Configuration Management tools with templating. Instead, we chose a mountain pass of defining Kubernetes Resources as Go code for compiled type checking, composability, validation, and potential for extension. The case study of a small team breaking trail through ecosystems of application design, schedule paradigms, deprecation dysentery, and holding legacy together with bailing wire. A retrospective of value added versus time wasted on the path to great opportunities on Kubernetes.  Talk Overview: Lytics Stack and overview(whoami) Loading the Wagon: Design and decision considerations(Read the Borg Paper) Deprecation Dysentery: Wait wait don’t use that. Mirages of disappointment: Systems which couldn’t make it to Kubernetes. Compute Resource Hunting Massacre: Avoiding compute underuse; taking advantage of scheduler. Handyman’s Corner: The bailing wire and zip-tie Kubernetes tools and services built to keep the broken axle(legacy systems) intact through the journey. Blizzards of the Kubernetes: from a user’s perspective who can’t follow every SIG; surviving the avalanche of ecosystem changes. Cascadia found: the wins, plans to rebuild what was abandoned, and breathing the free air. Next: Sim City"üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017  4:25pmüFriday December  8, 2017   5:00pmüBallroom B, Level 1

Istio’s highly extensible nature is one of the main selling points as it allows you to enforce your own organization-specific policies across large fleets of microservices. At the same time, new technology always has a learning curve, and with all this extensibility and generality the task can be quite daunting.  In this talk, Limin Wang (Software Engineer at Google) and Torin Sandall (Technical Lead of the Open Policy Agent project) explain how Istio’s Mixer works and lead a deep dive into Mixer Adapter development. The talk shows (with demos) how the Mixer Adapter model enables custom policy enforcement and how the model is used to integrate third party policy engines like the Open Policy Agent.  This talk is targeted at platform engineers interested in using the Istio service mesh to enforce custom policies in their microservices. The talk also provides new ideas about the kinds of policies that can be enforced in Istio today."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017  4:25pmüFriday December  8, 2017   5:00pmüMeeting Room 9AB, Level 3
cd90b17b565f95e8b36422e90a9a0a87üFrom Screen to Pods: Bootstrapping a Cloud Agnostic System using Kubernetes [I]üKubernetes 101 - KubeConü"Today, Algorithmia runs multiple Kubernetes clusters each with CPU and GPU nodes, 100s of pods, and 10,000s of containers created daily. We can create a copy of our entire stack in a variety of cloud environments in about an hour. Twelve months ago, Algorithmia was limited to AWS and reliant on an enterprise product for deployment management. In that time, we learned how to ensure a highly-available setup in multiple environments, handled networking issues between old applications and pod-based applications, discovered many quirks with cloud components (such as AWS ELB), learned what wrong assumptions we held about the cloud, and migrated our live production services to run within Kubernetes. We also learned the limits of Kubernetes and when to control components on our own. Ultimately, we reduced the number of servers needed to run our full stack, simplified the process of adding services, reduced dependency on particular cloud services, and have a hardened way to deploy our platform.  In this talk I’ll cover why we moved to Kubernetes to build our enterprise product, the benefits it entailed, difficulties we encountered with Kubernetes, containers, cloud providers, and what we’re most excited about in the future of Kubernetes."üIntermediateüFriday December  8, 2017  4:25pmüFriday December  8, 2017   5:00pmüMeeting Room 19AB, Level 4
