It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.Originally built at Lyft and now a CNCF incubating project, Envoy is a high performance C++ distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures. Envoy runs alongside every application and abstracts the network by providing common features in a platform-agnostic manner. When all service traffic in an infrastructure flows via an Envoy data plane, it becomes easy to monitor problem areas via consistent observability, tune overall performance, and add substrate features in a single place.SOLD OUTLearn more"#""#"Monday December 10, 2018  9:00am"#"Monday December 10, 2018   6:00pm"#"Tahoma 3/4 @ TCC"

One challenge with DNS-based service discovery though is the unreliable nature of the UDP protocol used by DNS. There is no guarantee of the delivery for the query and response of service records.  In this discussion, we provide a mechanism of CoreDNS over gRPC to address the reliability issue of DNS-based service discovery. As a flexible DNS server, CoreDNS is capable of transport over multiple protocols besides traditional UDP. With DNS over gRPC for inter-node communication and normal UDP for local-node DNS serving, we are able to achieve the much-needed reliability while maintaining the easy-to-use DNS front end for service discovery in Kubernetes clusters."#"Intermediate"#"Monday December 10, 2018  6:45pm"#"Monday December 10, 2018   6:50pm"#"Ballroom 6A"

Well, not quite: there are still some important unknowns to understand before your service will be ready for production. It's still unclear how the new service behaves when it's being pushed, and it's possible that K8s will kill the service before serving a single request. At Buffer, we've developed a technique to optimize K8s deployment limits using load testing to identify optimal resource limits. When the service is under heavy load there are a few key metrics to watch to identify bottlenecks. These key metrics can be used to adjust resource limits. This approach allowed us to safely and efficiently switch over more than half our production traffic to our K8s cluster and can be applied to any application.  This talk will include a live demo of how to tune Etcd using methods we do at Buffer."#"Any"#"Tuesday December 11, 2018 10:50am"#"Tuesday December 11, 2018 1 11:25am"#"Ballroom 6E"

In this talk, we will explore how Manifold used Kubernetes to migrate between cloud providers. We will look at how to identify cloud specific services and APIs in use in your application, and how Manifold evaluated whether to uplift to a Kubernetes abstraction, translate to the other cloud provider’s service, or keep as is.

Attackers could abuse this lack of isolation to move through a Kubernetes cluster after gaining a foothold in a container. Fortunately, there are many tools in the defenders’ toolbox that can be applied across multiple levels of the stack.In this survey talk, we will look at several recent or upcoming advancements in container isolation. You will learn about new kernel features, several "sandboxing" approaches, and features being developed in Kubernetes to harden the Pod and Node boundaries.

On top of this, there are dozens of tools, APIs and services available to use but they don’t all interoperate. Some tools work best with on prem while others works best with a specific public cloud.  The Cluster API is a new project bringing in members from many of these well-known tools and members from both public clouds and on-prem infrastructure software providers. The goal is to create a common declarative, kubernetes-style API, tools, and best practices that can be used to create day-zero solutions for deploying kubernetes to multiple platforms.

The two ends of the spectrum are to either deploy one monolithic application that handles multi-tenant data isolation via application logic or to deploy and proxy to many instances of isolated single-tenant applications.  This presentation will discuss how Kolide has approached the problem of application tenancy by building a Kubernetes Operator to manage the complete lifecycle of each tenant as an isolated instance of a single-tenant application.

We discuss testing against trace data rather than code, and how this technique opens the door to an entire suite of verification practices which are difficult to achieve with the current unit/integration test dichotomy.   We show that Trace Tests can span across multiple network calls, languages, and services, while still retaining unit-test-like ability to observe fine grained internal behavior. This combination is particularly useful in mircoservice and serverless environments.  In addition, Trace Testing ensure that behavior which is important enough to test in development is also observable in production.  We also propose that formal proof logic – which can catch new classes of bugs and help with live debugging – is not nearly as complicated once you have distributed tracing."#"Any"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018 10:50am"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018 1 11:25am"#"Ballroom 6E"

Why is there a PersistentVolumeClaim object when you could easily reference a volume directly from a pod?  To answer these questions and help you develop a deeper understanding of Kubernetes, this talk exposes the principles underpinning the design of Kubernetes."#"Any"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018  2:35pm"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018   3:10pm"#"Tahoma 1/2 @ TCC"

These new workloads introduce challenges both for both end users and cluster administrators. Data scientists want the flexibility to run any workload and library they require, data engineers want to ensure the scalability and reliability of production workloads, and cluster administrators want to maintain governance and control over cluster resources. At Cloudera, we’ve built a machine learning platform on Kubernetes that seeks to balance these competing objectives. In this talk, we will share some of the key design choices we made, lessons learned supporting large enterprise customers, and our vision of the road ahead for machine learning and AI on Kubernetes."#"Intermediate"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018  2:35pm"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018   3:10pm"#"Ballroom 6A"

Airflow offers a wide range of native operators for services ranging from Spark and HBase to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Until recently, the Airflow user experience has been hindered by the need to launch and maintain statically-sized Celery-based Airflow clusters. These clusters were both expensive (over and under-utilization) and complex (multiple points of failure).  To address these issues, we developed and published a native Kubernetes Operator and Kubernetes Executor for Apache Airflow.

Over time, they’ve received many questions from folks who are new to K8s, after taking the courses, or in training. They want to spend some time elaborating on the most common questions we’ve received, and answer them once in for all!  They’ll cover the following faq’s they get over and over again: - What kind of services should I use for my applications? - Shouldn’t I be using Istio instead of K8s now? What does K8s buy me when I can use istio? - How can we do capacity planning in K8s? - Why there is a high learning curve in K8s?

In this session we will firstly share our experiences working with load balancers on different cloud providers. After that, we will demonstrate a common solution based on CRD to enable sharing the same LoadBalancer among different services to reduce cost. In some L4 service scenarios, there are multiple TCP/UDP services need to be exposed publicly. Here comes a question: is it possible to only use one LoadBalancer to expose those services (on different ports)? Instead of being given multiple LoadBalancers which is neither cost effective nor user friendly. Furthermore, is there a common way to adapt to different cloud providers while maintaining a simple interface? We will explore these details through our demos."#"Intermediate"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018  4:30pm"#"Wednesday December 12, 2018   5:05pm"#"Tahoma 1/2 @ TCC"

However, running stateful applications such as Kafka on Kubernetes is not a common practice today. At Intuit, we took an experimentation and data driven approach for evaluating Kafka on Kubernetes in AWS. In this talk, we will provide details of our requirements, the configuration, and the details of the evaluation. The evaluation process included functional tests, network isolation tests, cross-region tests as well as performance and stress tests. We will focus on the problems we ran into and how we addressed them.  This talk will demonstrate a K8S cluster running Kafka and it's configuration using Kubernetes native components (statefulsets, configmaps, etc.).

In this talk we will do a deep dive into the different controllers that make up a CCM, and how they are keeping the state of your infrastructure consistent with the clusters resources. The main controllers behind the CCM are cloud agnostic and live in core kubernetes, but each provider has to specify its own implementation.

Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving complicated L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a service mesh to L2/L3 payloads. The NSM architecture can be naturally extended to allow interaction of the NSM with the physical network enabling cloud providers to offer value-add services like: Connecting a customers Pod(s) to a network egress specific to that customer Introspecting the Network Service Mesh control messaging to adapt the physical network to serve customer needs better. Allowing customers to request specific physical network services. The NSM community has developed several design patterns for solving problems in K8s that may be of utility to others working in other problem domains in K8s.

New vendors providing support for Kubernetes should feel equally empowered to do so as any of today’s existing cloud providers. More importantly, SIG Cloud Provider is focused on ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across providers. The SIG acts as a central group for developing the Kubernetes project in a way that ensures all providers share common privileges and responsibilities. As Kubernetes transitions from building all binaries necessary to create and run a Kubernetes cluster, to a new world in which Cloud Providers must supply some additional artifacts (Cloud Controller Manager, e.g.) to most effectively run, one area of concern is around how to manage the build and release process effectively. This deep dive session will be a working session to brainstorm how to manage this effectively. Questions for consideration include: - whether and how to include Cloud Provider e2e tests in the suite of release blocking tests for OSS Kubernetes - how to communicate to end users whether they need and how to obtain additional artifacts - how to manage optional addons and extensions in the validation of Kubernetes (e.g., CoreDNS on Kubernetes on N Cloud Providers), when those ecosystem projects evolve on their own release schedules.

It's getting a lot of attention, but in a lot of ways it's still a mystery. You've probably read about it, you might have tried it, but do you really understand it? It promises advances routing, security, and resiliency, all for free! In this session I'll present a practical introduction to the operation of Istio - what features it can bring to your environment.  What's unique about this talk is that we'll be exploring the different parts of Istio by following one plucky little packet into the mesh, through it, and out again. As we meet each component we'll learn why it's there, what it does, and see a demo of how to configure it for common tasks. This will leave you not only with slides showing example configs, but a valuable mental model and a unique insight into the service mesh's operation."#"Beginner"#"Thursday December 13, 2018 10:50am"#"Thursday December 13, 2018 1 11:25am"#"Ballroom 6E"

One of the challenges with automated deployments is making them safe by detecting and quickly rolling back in the event of a bad release.

Thanks to extensibility of Kubernetes, it is possible to build custom advanced deployment strategies while reusing Kubernetes core concepts.

We are proud to announce that Trickster, a new open source project, was developed to address this very issue.Written in Go, Trickster is a reverse proxy cache for the Prometheus HTTP APIv1 that considerably accelerates dashboard rendering times for any series queried from Prometheus.

Individual simulations are deployed as Fn functions that are called dynamically from workflows run within Jupyter notebooks. A notebook running on a lightweight k8s cluster can burst HPC workloads via Fn serverless calls to another cluster running on a bare metal HPC/GPU cloud. Using Fn, we have constructed a distributed access, authentication and accounting layer around a shared object store.

This presentation is very special and will talk about the dangers in using Kubernetes incorrectly. This presentation is drawn on years of real experience reports of providing Kubernetes as a service. We learn about the surprising ways users have used/abused Kubernetes, and how their creative use cases ended up causing catastrophic problems for the rest of the system. A simple example of one of these experience reports is running a large Java application in a docker container in Kubernetes, and how the JVM consumed more memory than the container allocated and ultimately put the node into dead lock. The audience walks away knowing they are not alone in their journey to tackle the new complexities of cloud native application management."#"Intermediate"#"Thursday December 13, 2018  1:45pm"#"Thursday December 13, 2018   2:20pm"#"606-609"

It is deployed on Kubernetes. The current deployment has thousands of pods across three datacenters, and is monitored by Prometheus. For scalability, our Prometheus cluster has sharded servers to monitor individual infrastructure components and federation servers to retrieve aggregated metrics from sharded servers. For high availability, each sharded/federated server is configured with an active/standby pair over its load-balancer. A routing map ( a time series) is automatically constructed by each shard server and assembled by the federation server, to direct Prometheus queries to the right servers. Today we have over 90 Prometheus servers on two datacenters to collect over 11 M metrics/60 seconds on 400 metrics (and 900 rules), to support health monitoring and performance debugging of NuData."#"Intermediate"#"Thursday December 13, 2018  3:40pm"#"Thursday December 13, 2018   4:15pm"#"Ballroom 6B"

Which machines are in service? How long have they been there? At New Relic, the ability to keep track of a massive inventory that runs across multiple providers quickly became an unbearable task so much so that it required designing a completely new central {tracking?} system that could scale with a large infrastructure. In this talk, you’ll learn how Jonathan Owens and Maryum Styles used the Kubernetes API server to jump-start this design and create a unified infrastructure description service.

How many nodes would it take to handle the traffic of an Alexa top-40 website? Understanding these numbers and how your ingress infrastructure scales is critical when it comes to deploying internet-accessible applications in production.   At Heptio, we needed to prove that our Envoy-based ingress projects, Contour and Gimbal, would scale to support millions of concurrent connections, thousands of backend services, and thousands of virtual hosts.  In this talk, we will explore the strategies and tools we used, the challenges we faced and the lessons we learned while running these tests. We will dive into kernel tuning, HTTP benchmarking, Envoy metrics, and more.
