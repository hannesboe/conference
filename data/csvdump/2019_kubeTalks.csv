To minimize race conditions, and other side effects of distributability, applications are often deployed with a replica count limited one or use primitives like StatefulSet to influence pod scheduling stickiness. Unfortunately, these are not enough to create truly distributed applications that can gracefully react to changes in their environment at runtime. While the controller and operator patterns have helped, they tend to use raw API primitives that are not related to building distributed systems.

Our microservices should be as close to pure business logic as possible, but what happens when we add so many services that our network requests are dramatically slowing the application down? The natural result is to look for some caching of requests on either the client or service side. Enter Redis, Memcached, and other caching tools all to help reduce network calls and overall latency. All of this comes with implementation penalty reducing the purity of our services. We will demonstrate how Istio's Mixer component can be used to cache requests at the request level and how that can keep your application fast, without ruining the purity of your services.";"Any (All levels of expertise would benefit from this session)";"Monday May 20, 2019 18:03";"Monday May 20, 2019 18:08";"Hall 8.0 A1";"2019-05-20T18:03:00";"2019-05-20T18:08:00"

For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting the Container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs. When a Container is starting, the kubelet has no way to tell whether the startup is deadlocked or just taking longer than expected.

After that, we will talk about *how* they can get started with contributing, move up the contributor ladder and become a regular contributor who serves the project. Lastly, we’ll look at some stories about how the existing contributors got started with their journey.";"Any (All levels of expertise would benefit from this session)";"Tuesday May 21, 2019 10:04";"Tuesday May 21, 2019 10:24";"Hall 6";"2019-05-21T10:04:00";"2019-05-21T10:24:00"

To compound the concern, many working in the tech community are at risk for burnout, a condition that often resembles mental illness. While lots of people in tech struggle with mental health, industry-specific research and advocacy in the community is disproportionately inadequate.For organizations, awareness and advocacy around employee mental health is crucial, after all, happy employees are more productive and less likely to leave their job. For employees who are struggling, it is important they know that they are not alone and there is help. This talk is focused on reducing the stigma around mental illness and expanding education and awareness into how to help yourself and others in your community.

There are several possible “extension points” in Envoy as outlined in https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/source/extensions. However, the currently available approaches to extend it is rather limited. Since Envoy is written in C++, the primary way to introduce new extended functionality in Envoy is by writing an extension (e.g. filters, either network or HTTP filter, as one of the most relevant use-cases in Envoy), in C++. It is also possible to write an extension for Envoy using Lua, but the current scope of this extension is only for HTTP traffic.

Kubernetes CSI support recently advanced to GA. In the longer term, there is a plan to deprecate existing legacy storage plugins. New storage-related functionality, such as snapshot support, is now being targeted for CSI only. The “in-tree” vSphere storage plugin remains fully supported at this time. but users running Kubernetes on vSphere may wish to change to CSI to gain new features. At some point in the future, migration to the CSI plugin will become mandatory. This session will explain and demonstrate deployment, configuration and use of the new vSphere CSI driver.

The topic is often associated with the Federation (v2) project. While Federation offers a solution to a problem (top-down resource declaration with templates, placements, and overrides), multicluster is about more than that. As Adrien was working on a different problem—peer-to-peer scheduling—he soon realized that some of the building blocks were missing: how to authorize requests from pods in a cluster to the Kubernetes APIs of other clusters; how to watch resources in a cluster to control resources in other clusters; how to garbage-collect objects in a cluster owned by objects in other clusters. Adrien started assembling an open-source ""multicluster toolbox"", composed of multicluster-service-account and multicluster-controller.

Then we’ll dive into specific security-oriented use cases, showing how you can use audit logs to enforce security best practices, detect misuse, and fill the gap between what you think the cluster is running and what's actually running. Some specific use cases we’ll discuss include misuse of configmaps to hold sensitive data, overly loose permissions on pods/services, and abuse of cluster role bindings that grant too many (or the wrong) permissions.

Accidentally. Twice. With little to no user impact. David shares how they recovered and learned to operate many clusters automatically and safely.  In 2017, Spotify planned the migration of hundreds of teams, thousands of services, and tens of thousands of hosts to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). In the last half of 2018, Spotify migrated 50 teams and hundreds of services, including critical ones, onto multiple production clusters.  David describes what led to the cluster deletions and how they barely affected users. Since the postmortem, Spotify has minimized downtime and human error by declaratively defining clusters in code with Terraform, backing up and restoring clusters with Ark, and increasing scalability and availability by running many more clusters.";"Any (All levels of expertise would benefit from this session)";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 09:05";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 09:25";"Hall 6";"2019-05-22T09:05:00";"2019-05-22T09:25:00"

When you have one cluster, you can manage it by hand. For 2-10 clusters, familiar tools work OK. But for more than 10, it's time for help. In my Kubernetes journey, I've seen stable tools fail under pressure. Even with good intentions, developers can throw a wrench into ideal consistent ops. This keynote covers how to scale to thousands of clusters worldwide. You'll also hear why observability for every cluster change is critical.

In this talk I separate fact from fiction. Storage on Kubernetes can mean a lot of things. First I will start by separating three layers: 1) consuming block and file storage from a pod running in Kubernetes, 2) deploying a stateful app (like a database) on Kubernetes using storage and workload primitives, and 3) deploying a software defined storage system on top of Kubernetes to provide block or file storage. Each of these areas has a different set of challenges that are often conflated to make storage on Kubernetes appear much harder than it is.  After separating these layers, I will help you understand what the challenges are with each of them, and how you work around them to effectively deploy stateful applications on Kubernetes.";"Any (All levels of expertise would benefit from this session)";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 09:58";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 10:18";"Hall 6";"2019-05-22T09:58:00";"2019-05-22T10:18:00"

However, not all infrastructure is alike: some clouds do not provide GPUs, while others do not offer data-centers in certain regions. As a result, users often have to choose between running their entire workload on a single cloud provider or region, and managing multiple clusters in different clouds.

This is disruptive to services, and expensive for long-running applications or jobs. It is very important to have the ability to scale pod resources without restarts.  In this talk, Vinay and Peng will present a design for restart-free scaling of pod resources, with container restart as a policy-controlled choice rather than a necessity. They will illustrate a customer use case, a gene-sequencing application where pod restart is expensive. They will go over the changes to Kubernetes components that made this feature possible. They will discuss how they addressed some unique challenges such as multiple scheduler race conditions, and respecting pod disruption budget if pod restart is needed. They will talk about how failures are handled via smart retries, and conclude with a demo.";"Intermediate (Mid-level experience)";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 11:05";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 11:40";"Hall 8.0 C1";"2019-05-22T11:05:00";"2019-05-22T11:40:00"

A Deep Dive into Pod Readiness Gates for Service Health Management";"Customizing + Extending Kubernetes";"This talk will be a deep dive on “pod readiness gates”, a new Kubernetes API for extending pod readiness with custom external controllers and introduce its usage in real world scenarios with service health management. Kubernetes clusters that integrate with external network infrastructure (such as a cloud provider) need a way to coordinate Kubernetes Pod “readiness” with setup latencies in the network fabric. Not tackling this problem causes lost packets and dropped connections OR requires inserting worst-case delays to pod startup to account for external setup.

At peak hours Go-pay does ~15k Financial transactions/minute. The complete infra used to run on ~1500 VMs with > 130 micro-services. The talk is about our journey from 1500 VMs to 15 K8 VMs without a single downtime. It will cover the problems that we faced, how we handled those problems. With our international expansion, we wanted to have easier, faster cluster setup. So we decided to move gopay to k8s. To list down a few issues in our path:  1. Go-pay runs with our custom client side load balancing with service discovery. This works well with VMs having static IPs. But with containers every deployment change IP addresses.  2. To lower down risks we wanted to run VMs in parallel with kubernetes pods. But they are in different network, VMs in underlay and pods in kube’s overlay network.";"Intermediate (Mid-level experience)";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 15:55";"Wednesday May 22, 2019 16:30";"Hall 8.0 C1";"2019-05-22T15:55:00";"2019-05-22T16:30:00"

That the API is a set of resources rather than a list of methods on objects is a bit mind bending. But this programming model is not entirely new – rather, it smacks quite heavily of functional programming.  Functional programming had mostly been relegated to academic endeavors until recently. What’s changed that is that our apps are now distributed systems and are simply too complex for us to reason about without help. Kubernetes helps.   In order to effectively use Kubernetes to deploy and manage your workloads you need to understand some of the principles of functional programming and how they surface in K8s. In this session I will cover these underlying principles of the K8s programming model so that you can up the robustness and manageability of your application deployments.";"Intermediate (Mid-level experience)";"Thursday May 23, 2019 11:05";"Thursday May 23, 2019 11:40";"Hall 8.0 A1";"2019-05-23T11:05:00";"2019-05-23T11:40:00"

There are many ways to try and avoid these problems, but one way is to stop items getting on the release train until it's ready.  Istio does many things, but the traffic management functionality is the key to this solution. It allows traffic to be routed to different versions of the same service.

In order to prove that, we made the first attempt to define what does it mean that “Kubernetes scales to X-node clusters”. The SLOs making that definition were described in more detail in the first scalability-related Kubernetes blog post. However, as Kubernetes was maturing and new features were being added to it, it turned out that the initial definition is becoming meaningless, especially for larger users.

As we’ve been developing our own Kubernetes distribution and some additional tooling for Kubernetes, we’ve also build a new client library for the API in Ruby, k8s-client (https://github.com/kontena/k8s-client). While building and maintaining the client library we've stumbled on few, well, odd things on the API and faced some technical challenges also. In this session we'll go through some the most interesting findings and how we've tackled them.

Finally, the talk will discuss upcoming technologies that will allow Kubernetes to scale even further.";"Intermediate (Mid-level experience)";"Thursday May 23, 2019 16:45";"Thursday May 23, 2019 17:20";"Hall 8.0 B3";"2019-05-23T16:45:00";"2019-05-23T17:20:00"

This growth has created new challenges for Uber’s engineering team and the services they maintain. How can these services reliably identify and authenticate to each other? How can we ensure isolation for critical systems? How can we achieve compliance with regulations like GDPR and SOX? How can we efficiently incorporate identity into unsupported legacy systems? Most importantly, how can we do all of this in a way that doesn’t get in the way of engineers?This talk will explore what led Uber to build out an automated, API-driven, cloud native approach to workload identity with SPIFFE that provides the critical bridge of trust within Uber's next-gen infrastructure, and the impact it’s had on Uber’s internal security and developer efficiency.";"Intermediate (Mid-level experience)";"Thursday May 23, 2019 16:45";"Thursday May 23, 2019 17:20";"Hall 8.0 F5";"2019-05-23T16:45:00";"2019-05-23T17:20:00"

As part of research at the Carnegie Mellon University to better understand the advantages and limitations of serverless platforms, we assessed Knative for two workloads that may differ from typical Web applications -- Machine Learning inference (ML) and Interactive Computing (IC). We focused on properties which are important for workloads with significant amount of state - such as ML model, or IC session - while still maintaining the ability to scale down to zero (and back to one) efficiently. In this talk we will present the initial results of an effort to design a Kubernetes-based serverless platform optimized for such workloads, focusing on two properties: 1) ability to efficiently persist state, 2) ability to deliver low latency under load spikes.";"Intermediate (Mid-level experience)";"Thursday May 23, 2019 16:45";"Thursday May 23, 2019 17:20";"Hall 8.1 G1";"2019-05-23T16:45:00";"2019-05-23T17:20:00"

We rarely bother, or when we do, it’s hard-coded at the application level. Holes are punched in our ingress. Traffic traverses the open internet with hand-crafted addresses, no observability, and one-way TLS.  Istio already helps communication within a cluster: adding layer 7 routing, automatic security and more. The new version 1.1 can now do that between clusters.  This talk will guide you through using Istio’s latest features to easily setup secure, resilient, cross-cluster communication. Matt will talk through the required config before showing a demo of an app seamlessly spanning Kubernetes clusters. The full config will be made available so you can head straight home and give it a go on your own systems!";"Intermediate (Mid-level experience)";"Thursday May 23, 2019 16:45";"Thursday May 23, 2019 17:20";"Hall 8.0 F3";"2019-05-23T16:45:00";"2019-05-23T17:20:00"
